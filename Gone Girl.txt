BOY
LOSES GIRL

NICK DUNNE
THE DAY OF

When I think of my
wife, I always think of her
head. The shape of it, to
begin with. The very first
time I saw her, it was the

back of the head I saw,
and there was something
lovely about it, the angles
of it. Like a shiny, hard
corn kernel or a riverbed
fossil. She had what the
Victorians would call a
finely shaped head. You
could imagine the skull
quite easily.
Iʼd know her head
anywhere.
And whatʼs inside it. I

think of that too: her
mind. Her brain, all those
coils, and her thoughts
shuttling through those
coils like fast, frantic
centipedes. Like a child, I
picture opening her skull,
unspooling her brain and
sifting through it, trying to
catch and pin down her
thoughts. What are you
thinking,
Amy?
The
question Iʼve asked most

often during our marriage,
if not out loud, if not to
the person who could
answer. I suppose these
questions stormcloud over
every marriage: What are
you thinking? How are you
feeling? Who are you? What
have we done to each other?
What will we do?
My eyes flipped open at
exactly six A.M. This was
no avian fluttering of the

lashes, no gentle blink
toward consciousness. The
awakening
was
mechanical. A spooky
ventriloquist-dummy click
of the lids: The world is
black and then, showtime!
6-0-0 the clock said—in
my face, first thing I saw.
6-0-0. It felt different. I
rarely woke at such a
rounded time. I was a man
of jagged risings: 8:43,

11:51, 9:26. My life was
alarmless.
At that exact moment,
6-0-0, the sun climbed
over the skyline of oaks,
revealing its full summer
angry-god
self.
Its
reflection flared across the
river toward our house, a
long, blaring finger aimed
at me through our frail
bedroom
curtains.
Accusing: You have been

seen. You will be seen.
I wallowed in bed,
which was our New York
bed in our new house,
which we still called the
new house, even though
weʼd been back here for
two years. Itʼs a rented
house right along the
Mississippi River, a house
that screams Suburban
Nouveau Riche, the kind
of place I aspired to as a

kid from my split-level,
shag-carpet side of town.
The kind of house that is
immediately familiar: a
generically
grand,
unchallenging, new, new,
new house that my wife
would—and did—detest.
“Should I remove my
soul before I come inside?”
Her first line upon arrival.
It had been a compromise:
Amy demanded we rent,

not buy, in my little
Missouri hometown, in her
firm
hope
that
we
wouldnʼt be stuck here
long. But the only houses
for rent were clustered in
this failed development: a
miniature ghost town of
bank-owned,
recessionbusted,
price-reduced
mansions, a neighborhood
that closed before it ever
opened.
It
was
a

compromise, but Amy
didnʼt see it that way, not
in the least. To Amy, it
was a punishing whim on
my part, a nasty, selfish
twist of the knife. I would
drag her, caveman-style, to
a
town
she
had
aggressively avoided, and
make her live in the kind
of house she used to mock.
I suppose itʼs not a
compromise if only one of

you considers it such, but
that
was
what
our
compromises tended to
look like. One of us was
always
angry.
Amy,
usually.
Do not blame me for
this particular grievance,
Amy.
The
Missouri
Grievance.
Blame
the
economy, blame bad luck,
blame my parents, blame
your parents, blame the

Internet, blame people
who use the Internet. I
used to be a writer. I was a
writer who wrote about TV
and movies and books.
Back when people read
things on paper, back
when anyone cared about
what I thought. Iʼd arrived
in New York in the late
ʼ90s, the last gasp of the
glory days, although no
one knew it then. New

York was packed with
writers,
real
writers,
because
there
were
magazines, real magazines,
loads of them. This was
back when the Internet
was still some exotic pet
kept in the corner of the
publishing world—throw
some kibble at it, watch it
dance on its little leash, oh
quite cute, it definitely
wonʼt kill us in the night.

Think about it: a time
when newly graduated
college kids could come to
New York and get paid to
write. We had no clue that
we were embarking on
careers that would vanish
within a decade.
I had a job for eleven
years and then I didnʼt, it
was that fast. All around
the country, magazines
began
shuttering,

succumbing to a sudden
infection brought on by
the
busted
economy.
Writers (my kind of
writers: aspiring novelists,
ruminative
thinkers,
people whose brains donʼt
work quick enough to blog
or link or tweet, basically
old, stubborn blowhards)
were through. We were
like womenʼs hat makers
or
buggy-whip

manufacturers: Our time
was done. Three weeks
after I got cut loose, Amy
lost her job, such as it was.
(Now I can feel Amy
looking over my shoulder,
smirking at the time Iʼve
spent
discussing
my
career, my misfortune, and
dismissing her experience
in one sentence. That, she
would tell you, is typical.
Just like Nick, she would

say. It was a refrain of
hers: Just like Nick to …
and whatever followed,
whatever was just like me,
was bad.) Two jobless
grown-ups,
we
spent
weeks wandering around
our Brooklyn brownstone
in socks and pajamas,
ignoring
the
future,
strewing unopened mail
across tables and sofas,
eating ice cream at ten

A.M. and taking thick
afternoon naps.
Then one day the
phone rang. My twin sister
was on the other end.
Margo had moved back
home after her own New
York layoff a year before—
the girl is one step ahead
of me in everything, even
shitty luck. Margo, calling
from good ole North
Carthage, Missouri, from

the house where we grew
up, and as I listened to her
voice, I saw her at age ten,
with a dark cap of hair and
overall shorts, sitting on
our grandparentsʼ back
dock, her body slouched
over like an old pillow, her
skinny legs dangling in the
water, watching the river
flow over fish-white feet,
so intently, utterly selfpossessed even as a child.

Goʼs voice was warm
and crinkly even as she
gave this cold news: Our
indomitable mother was
dying. Our dad was nearly
gone—his (nasty) mind,
his (miserable) heart, both
murky as he meandered
toward the great gray
beyond. But it looked like
our mother would beat
him there. About six
months, maybe a year, she

had. I could tell that Go
had gone to meet with the
doctor by herself, taken
her studious notes in her
slovenly handwriting, and
she was teary as she tried
to decipher what sheʼd
written. Dates and doses.
“Well, fuck, I have no
idea what this says, is it a
nine? Does that even make
sense?” she said, and I
interrupted. Here was a

task, a purpose, held out
on my sisterʼs palm like a
plum. I almost cried with
relief.
“Iʼll come back, Go.
Weʼll move back home.
You shouldnʼt have to do
this all by yourself.”
She didnʼt believe me. I
could hear her breathing
on the other end.
“Iʼm serious, Go. Why
not?
Thereʼs
nothing

here.”
A long exhale. “What
about Amy?”
That is what I didnʼt
take long enough to
consider. I simply assumed
I would bundle up my New
York wife with her New
York interests, her New
York pride, and remove
her from her New York
parents—leave the frantic,
thrilling futureland of

Manhattan
behind—and
transplant her to a little
town on the river in
Missouri, and all would be
fine.
I
did
not
yet
understand how foolish,
how optimistic, how, yes,
just like Nick I was for
thinking this. The misery it
would lead to.
“Amy will be fine.
Amy …” Here was where I

should have said, “Amy
loves Mom.” But I couldnʼt
tell Go that Amy loved our
mother, because after all
that time, Amy still barely
knew our mother. Their
few meetings had left them
both baffled. Amy would
dissect the conversations
for days after—“And what
did she mean by …”—as if
my mother were some
ancient
peasant

tribeswoman arriving from
the tundra with an armful
of raw yak meat and some
buttons
for
bartering,
trying to get something
from Amy that wasnʼt on
offer.
Amy didnʼt care to
know my family, didnʼt
want
to
know
my
birthplace, and yet for
some reason, I thought
moving home would be a

good idea.
My morning breath
warmed the pillow, and I
changed the subject in my
mind. Today was not a day
for second-guessing or
regret, it was a day for
doing. Downstairs, I could
hear the return of a longlost sound: Amy making
breakfast. Banging wooden
cupboards (rump-thump!),
rattling containers of tin

and glass (ding-ring!),
shuffling and sorting a
collection of metal pots
and iron pans (ruzzshuzz!).
A
culinary
orchestra
tuning
up,
clattering
vigorously
toward the finale, a cake
pan drumrolling along the
floor, hitting the wall with
a
cymballic
crash.
Something impressive was
being created, probably a

crepe, because crepes are
special, and today Amy
would want to cook
something special.
It was our five-year
anniversary.
I walked barefoot to
the edge of the steps and
stood listening, working
my toes into the plush
wall-to-wall carpet Amy
detested on principle, as I
tried to decide whether I

was ready to join my wife.
Amy was in the kitchen,
oblivious to my hesitation.
She
was
humming
something melancholy and
familiar. I strained to make
it out—a folk song? a
lullabye?—and
then
realized it was the theme
to M*A*S*H. Suicide is
painless.
I
went
downstairs.
I hovered in the

doorway, watching my
wife. Her yellow-butter
hair was pulled up, the
hank of ponytail swinging
cheerful as a jump-rope,
and she was sucking
distractedly on a burnt
fingertip, humming around
it. She hummed to herself
because she was an
unrivaled botcher of lyrics.
When we were first dating,
a Genesis song came on

the radio: “She seems to
have an invisible touch,
yeah.” And Amy crooned
instead, “She takes my hat
and puts it on the top
shelf.” When I asked her
why sheʼd ever think her
lyrics
were
remotely,
possibly, vaguely right, she
told
me
she
always
thought the woman in the
song truly loved the man
because she put his hat on

the top shelf. I knew I liked
her then, really liked her,
this
girl
with
an
explanation for everything.
Thereʼs
something
disturbing about recalling
a warm memory and
feeling utterly cold.
Amy peered at the
crepe sizzling in the pan
and licked something off
her wrist. She looked
triumphant, wifely. If I

took her in my arms, she
would smell like berries
and powdered sugar.
When she spied me
lurking there in grubby
boxers, my hair in full
Heat Miser spike, she
leaned against the kitchen
counter and said, “Well,
hello, handsome.”
Bile and dread inched
up my throat. I thought to
myself: Okay, go.

I was very late getting
to work. My sister and I
had done a foolish thing
when we both moved back
home. We had done what
we always talked about
doing. We opened a bar.
We borrowed money from
Amy to do this, eighty
thousand dollars, which
was once nothing to Amy
but by then was almost
everything. I swore I

would pay her back, with
interest. I would not be a
man who borrowed from
his wife—I could feel my
dad twisting his lips at the
very idea. Well, there are
all kinds of men, his most
damning
phrase,
the
second half left unsaid,
and you are the wrong kind.
But truly, it was a
practical decision, a smart
business move. Amy and I

both needed new careers;
this would be mine. She
would pick one someday,
or not, but in the
meantime, here was an
income, made possible by
the last of Amyʼs trust
fund. Like the McMansion
I rented, the bar featured
symbolically
in
my
childhood
memories—a
place where only grownups go, and do whatever

grown-ups
do.
Maybe
thatʼs why I was so
insistent on buying it after
being stripped of my
livelihood. Itʼs a reminder
that I am, after all, an
adult, a grown man, a
useful human being, even
though I lost the career
that made me all these
things. I wonʼt make that
mistake again: The once
plentiful
herds
of

magazine writers would
continue to be culled—by
the Internet, by the
recession, by the American
public, who would rather
watch TV or play video
games or electronically
inform friends that, like,
rain sucks! But thereʼs no
app for a bourbon buzz on
a warm day in a cool, dark
bar. The world will always
want a drink.

Our bar is a corner bar
with
a
haphazard,
patchwork aesthetic. Its
best feature is a massive
Victorian backbar, dragon
heads and angel faces
emerging from the oak—
an extravagant work of
wood in these shitty
plastic
days.
The
remainder of the bar is, in
fact, shitty, a showcase of
the
shabbiest
design

offerings of every decade:
an
Eisenhower-era
linoleum floor, the edges
turned up like burnt toast;
dubious
wood-paneled
walls straight from a ʼ70s
home-porn video; halogen
floor lamps, an accidental
tribute to my 1990s dorm
room. The ultimate effect
is strangely homey—it
looks less like a bar than
someoneʼs
benignly

neglected fixer-upper. And
jovial: We share a parking
lot with the local bowling
alley, and when our door
swings wide, the clatter of
strikes
applauds
the
customerʼs entrance.
We named the bar The
Bar. “People will think
weʼre ironic instead of
creatively bankrupt,” my
sister reasoned.
Yes, we thought we

were being clever New
Yorkers—that the name
was a joke no one else
would really get, not get
like we did. Not meta-get.
We pictured the locals
scrunching their noses:
Whyʼd you name it The
Bar?
But
our
first
customer, a gray-haired
woman in bifocals and a
pink jogging suit, said, “I
like the name. Like in

Breakfast at Tiffanyʼs and
Audrey Hepburnʼs cat was
named Cat.”
We felt much less
superior after that, which
was a good thing.
I pulled into the
parking lot. I waited until
a strike erupted from the
bowling alley—thank you,
thank you, friends—then
stepped out of the car. I
admired the surroundings,

still not bored with the
broken-in
view:
the
squatty blond-brick post
office across the street
(now closed on Saturdays),
the
unassuming
beige
office building just down
the way (now closed,
period). The town wasnʼt
prosperous, not anymore,
not by a long shot. Hell, it
wasnʼt even original, being
one of two Carthage,

Missouris—ours
is
technically North Carthage,
which makes it sound like
a twin city, although itʼs
hundreds of miles from the
other and the lesser of the
two: a quaint little 1950s
town that bloated itself
into a basic midsize suburb
and dubbed it progress.
Still, it was where my
mom grew up and where
she raised me and Go, so it

had some history. Mine, at
least.
As I walked toward the
bar across the concreteand-weed parking lot, I
looked straight down the
road and saw the river.
Thatʼs what Iʼve always
loved about our town: We
arenʼt built on some safe
bluff
overlooking
the
Mississippi—we are on the
Mississippi. I could walk

down the road and step
right into the sucker, an
easy three-foot drop, and
be on my way to
Tennessee. Every building
downtown bears handdrawn lines from where
the river hit during the
Flood of ʼ61, ʼ75, ʼ84, ʼ93,
ʼ07, ʼ08, ʼ11. And so on.
The
river
wasnʼt
swollen now, but it was
running urgently, in strong

ropy currents. Moving
apace with the river was a
long single-file line of
men, eyes aimed at their
feet,
shoulders
tense,
walking
steadfastly
nowhere. As I watched
them, one suddenly looked
up at me, his face in
shadow, an oval blackness.
I turned away.
I felt an immediate,
intense need to get inside.

By the time Iʼd gone
twenty feet, my neck
bubbled with sweat. The
sun was still an angry eye
in the sky. You have been
seen.
My gut twisted, and I
moved quicker. I needed a
drink.

2005

DIARY ENTRY

Tra and la! I am
smiling a big adoptedorphan smile as I write
this. I am embarrassed at
how happy I am, like some

Technicolor comic of a
teenage girl talking on the
phone with my hair in a
ponytail, the bubble above
my head saying: I met a
boy!
But I did. This is a
technical, empirical truth.
I met a boy, a great,
gorgeous dude, a funny,
cool-ass guy. Let me set
the scene, because it
deserves
setting
for

posterity (no, please, Iʼm
not
that
far
gone,
posterity! feh). But still.
Itʼs not New Yearʼs, but
still very much the new
year. Itʼs winter: early
dark, freezing cold.
Carmen,
a
newish
friend—semi-friend, barely
friend, the kind of friend
you canʼt cancel on—has
talked me into going out to
Brooklyn, to one of her

writersʼ parties. Now, I
like a writer party, I like
writers, I am the child of
writers, I am a writer. I
still love scribbling that
word—WRITER—anytime
a form, questionnaire,
document asks for my
occupation. Fine, I write
personality quizzes, I donʼt
write about the Great
Issues of the Day, but I
think itʼs fair to say I am a

writer. Iʼm using this
journal to get better: to
hone my skills, to collect
details and observations.
To show donʼt tell and all
that other writery crap.
(Adopted-orphan smile, I
mean, thatʼs not bad, come
on.) But really, I do think
my quizzes alone qualify
me on at least an honorary
basis. Right?
At a party you find

yourself
surrounded
by
genuine talented writers,
employed at high-profile,
respected newspapers and
magazines. You merely write
quizzes for womenʼs rags.
When someone asks what
you do for a living, you:
a) Get
embarrassed and
say, “Iʼm just a
quiz writer, itʼs
silly stuff!”

b) Go on
the offense: “Iʼm
a writer now, but
Iʼm considering
something more
challenging and
worthwhile—
why, what do you
do?”
c) Take
pride in your
accomplishments:
“I
write

personality
quizzes using the
knowledge
gleaned from my
masterʼs degree in
psychology—oh,
and fun fact: I am
the inspiration for
a
beloved
childrenʼs-book
series, Iʼm sure
you
know
it,
Amazing
Amy?

Yeah, so suck it,
snobdouche!
Answer: C,
totally C
Anyway, the party is
being thrown by one of
Carmenʼs good friends
who writes about movies
for a movie magazine, and
is very funny, according to
Carmen. I worry for a
second that she wants to
set us up: I am not

interested in being set up.
I need to be ambushed,
caught unawares, like
some sort of feral lovejackal. Iʼm too selfconscious otherwise. I feel
myself
trying
to
be
charming, and then I
realize
Iʼm
obviously
trying to be charming, and
then I try to be even more
charming to make up for
the fake charm, and then

Iʼve basically turned into
Liza Minnelli: Iʼm dancing
in tights and sequins,
begging you to love me.
Thereʼs a bowler and jazz
hands and lots of teeth.
But no, I realize, as
Carmen gushes on about
her friend: She likes him.
Good.
We climb three flights
of warped stairs and walk
into a whoosh of body

heat and writerness: many
black-framed glasses and
mops of hair; faux western
shirts
and
heathery
turtlenecks; black wool
pea-coats
flopped
all
across the couch, puddling
to the floor; a German
poster for The Getaway
(Ihre Chance war gleich
Null!) covering one paintcracked
wall.
Franz
Ferdinand on the stereo:

“Take Me Out.”
A clump of guys hovers
near a card table where all
the alcohol is set up,
tipping more booze into
their cups after every few
sips, all too aware of how
little is left to go around. I
nudge in, aiming my
plastic cup in the center
like a busker, get a clatter
of ice cubes and a splash
of vodka from a sweet-

faced guy wearing a Space
Invaders T-shirt.
A lethal-looking bottle
of green-apple liqueur, the
hostʼs ironic purchase, will
soon be our fate unless
someone makes a booze
run, and that seems
unlikely,
as
everyone
clearly believes they made
the run last time. It is a
January party, definitely,
everyone still glutted and

sugar-pissed
from
the
holidays, lazy and irritated
simultaneously. A party
where people drink too
much and pick cleverly
worded fights, blowing
cigarette smoke out an
open window even after
the host asks them to go
outside. Weʼve already
talked to one another at a
thousand holiday parties,
we have nothing left to

say, we are collectively
bored, but we donʼt want
to go back into the
January cold; our bones
still ache from the subway
steps.
I have lost Carmen to
her host-beau—they are
having
an
intense
discussion in a corner of
the kitchen, the two of
them
hunching
their
shoulders,
their
faces

toward each other, the
shape of a heart. Good. I
think about eating to give
myself something to do
besides standing in the
center of the room, smiling
like the new kid in the
lunchroom. But almost
everything is gone. Some
potato-chip shards sit in
the bottom of a giant
Tupperware
bowl.
A
supermarket deli tray full

of hoary carrots and
gnarled celery and a
semeny dip sits untouched
on
a
coffee
table,
cigarettes
littered
throughout like bonus
vegetable sticks. I am
doing my thing, my
impulse thing: What if I
leap from the theater
balcony right now? What
if I tongue the homeless
man across from me on the

subway? What if I sit
down on the floor of this
party by myself and eat
everything on that deli
tray,
including
the
cigarettes?
“Please
donʼt
eat
anything in that area,” he
says. It is him (bum bum
BUMMM!), but I donʼt yet
know itʼs him (bum-bumbummm). I know itʼs a guy
who will talk to me, he

wears his cockiness like an
ironic T-shirt, but it fits
him better. He is the kind
of guy who carries himself
like he gets laid a lot, a
guy who likes women, a
guy who would actually
fuck me properly. I would
like to be fucked properly!
My dating life seems to
rotate around three types
of
men:
preppy
Ivy
Leaguers
who
believe

theyʼre characters in a
Fitzgerald novel; slick Wall
Streeters with money signs
in their eyes, their ears,
their mouths; and sensitive
smart-boys who are so selfaware that everything feels
like a joke. The Fitzgerald
fellows
tend
to
be
ineffectively porny in bed,
a lot of noise and
acrobatics to very little
end. The finance guys turn

rageful and flaccid. The
smart-boys
fuck
like
theyʼre composing a piece
of math rock: This hand
strums around here, and
then this finger offers a
nice bass rhythm.… I
sound quite slutty, donʼt I?
Pause while I count how
many … eleven. Not bad.
Iʼve always thought twelve
was a solid, reasonable
number to end at.

“Seriously,” Number 12
continues. (Ha!) “Back
away from the tray. James
has up to three other food
items in his refrigerator. I
could make you an olive
with mustard. Just one
olive, though.”
Just one olive, though. It
is a line that is only a little
funny, but it already has
the feel of an inside joke,
one that will get funnier

with nostalgic repetition. I
think: A year from now, we
will be walking along the
Brooklyn Bridge at sunset
and one of us will whisper,
“Just one olive, though,” and
weʼll start to laugh. (Then I
catch myself. Awful. If he
knew I was doing a year
from now already, heʼd run
and Iʼd be obliged to cheer
him on.)
Mainly, I will admit, I

smile
because
heʼs
gorgeous.
Distractingly
gorgeous, the kind of looks
that make your eyes
pinwheel, that make you
want to just address the
elephant—“You
know
youʼre gorgeous, right?”—
and move on with the
conversation. I bet dudes
hate him: He looks like the
rich-boy villain in an ʼ80s
teen movie—the one who

bullies the sensitive misfit,
the one who will end up
with a pie in the puss, the
whipped cream wilting his
upturned
collar
as
everyone in the cafeteria
cheers.
He doesnʼt act that
way, though. His name is
Nick. I love it. It makes
him seem nice, and
regular, which he is. When
he tells me his name, I say,

“Now, thatʼs a real name.”
He brightens and reels off
some line: “Nickʼs the kind
of guy you can drink a
beer with, the kind of guy
who doesnʼt mind if you
puke in his car. Nick!”
He makes a series of
awful puns. I catch threefourths of his movie
references.
Two-thirds,
maybe. (Note to self: Rent
The Sure Thing.) He refills

my drink without me
having to ask, somehow
ferreting out one last cup
of the good stuff. He has
claimed me, placed a flag
in me: I was here first, sheʼs
mine, mine. It feels nice,
after my recent series of
nervous, respectful postfeminist men, to be a
territory. He has a great
smile, a catʼs smile. He
should cough out yellow

Tweety Bird feathers, the
way he smiles at me. He
doesnʼt ask what I do for a
living, which is fine, which
is a change. (Iʼm a writer,
did I mention?) He talks to
me in his river-wavy
Missouri accent; he was
born and raised outside of
Hannibal, the boyhood
home of Mark Twain, the
inspiration
for
Tom
Sawyer. He tells me he

worked on a steamboat
when he was a teenager,
dinner and jazz for the
tourists. And when I laugh
(bratty, bratty New York
girl
who
has
never
ventured to those big
unwieldy middle states,
those States Where Many
Other People Live), he
informs me that Missoura
is a magical place, the
most beautiful in the

world, no state more
glorious. His eyes are
mischievous, his lashes are
long. I can see what he
looked like as a boy.
We share a taxi home,
the streetlights making
dizzy shadows and the car
speeding as if weʼre being
chased. It is one A.M.
when we hit one of New
Yorkʼs
unexplained
deadlocks twelve blocks

from my apartment, so we
slide out of the taxi into
the cold, into the great
What Next? and Nick
starts walking me home,
his hand on the small of
my back, our faces stunned
by the chill. As we turn the
corner, the local bakery is
getting its powdered sugar
delivered, funneled into
the cellar by the barrelful
as if it were cement, and

we can see nothing but the
shadows
of
the
deliverymen in the white,
sweet cloud. The street is
billowing, and Nick pulls
me close and smiles that
smile again, and he takes a
single lock of my hair
between two fingers and
runs them all the way to
the end, tugging twice,
like heʼs ringing a bell. His
eyelashes are trimmed

with powder, and before
he leans in, he brushes the
sugar from my lips so he
can taste me.

NICK DUNNE
THE DAY OF

I swung wide the door
of my bar, slipped into the
darkness, and took my first
real deep breath of the
day, took in the smell of

cigarettes and beer, the
spice
of
a
dribbled
bourbon, the tang of old
popcorn. There was only
one customer in the bar,
sitting by herself at the far,
far end: an older woman
named Sue who had come
in every Thursday with her
husband until he died
three months back. Now
she came alone every
Thursday, never much for

conversation, just sitting
with a beer and a
crossword, preserving a
ritual.
My sister was at work
behind the bar, her hair
pulled back in nerdy-girl
barrettes, her arms pink as
she dipped the beer glasses
in and out of hot suds. Go
is slender and strangefaced, which is not to say
unattractive. Her features

just take a moment to
make sense: the broad jaw;
the pinched, pretty nose;
the dark globe eyes. If this
were a period movie, a
man would tilt back his
fedora, whistle at the sight
of her, and say, “Now,
thereʼs a helluva broad!”
The face of a ʼ30s
screwball-movie
queen
doesnʼt always translate in
our pixie-princess times,

but I know from our years
together that men like my
sister, a lot, which puts me
in that strange brotherly
realm of being both proud
and wary.
“Do they still make
pimento loaf?” she said by
way of greeting, not
looking up, just knowing it
was me, and I felt the
relief I usually felt when I
saw her: Things might not

be great, but things would
be okay.
My twin, Go. Iʼve said
this phrase so many times,
it has become a reassuring
mantra instead of actual
words: Mytwingo. We
were born in the ʼ70s,
back when twins were
rare, a bit magical: cousins
of the unicorn, siblings of
the elves. We even have a
dash of twin telepathy. Go

is truly the one person in
the entire world I am
totally myself with. I donʼt
feel the need to explain my
actions to her. I donʼt
clarify, I donʼt doubt, I
donʼt worry. I donʼt tell
her
everything,
not
anymore, but I tell her
more than anyone else, by
far. I tell her as much as I
can. We spent nine months
back to back, covering

each other. It became a
lifelong habit. It never
mattered to me that she
was a girl, strange for a
deeply self-conscious kid.
What can I say? She was
always just cool.
“Pimento loaf, thatʼs
like lunch meat, right? I
think they do.”
“We should get some,”
she said. She arched an
eyebrow at me. “Iʼm

intrigued.”
Without asking, she
poured me a draft of PBR
into a mug of questionable
cleanliness. When she
caught me staring at the
smudged rim, she brought
the glass up to her mouth
and licked the smudge
away, leaving a smear of
saliva. She set the mug
squarely in front of me.
“Better, my prince?”

Go firmly believes that
I got the best of everything
from our parents, that I
was the boy they planned
on, the single child they
could afford, and that she
sneaked into this world by
clamping onto my ankle,
an unwanted stranger. (For
my dad, a particularly
unwanted stranger.) She
believes she was left to
fend for herself throughout

childhood,
a
pitiful
creature of random handme-downs and forgotten
permission slips, tightened
budgets
and
general
regret. This vision could be
somewhat true; I can
barely stand to admit it.
“Yes, my squalid little
serf,” I said, and fluttered
my
hands
in
royal
dispensation.
I huddled over my

beer. I needed to sit and
drink a beer or three. My
nerves were still singing
from the morning.
“Whatʼs up with you?”
she asked. “You look all
twitchy.” She flicked some
suds at me, more water
than
soap.
The
airconditioning kicked on,
ruffling the tops of our
heads. We spent more time
in The Bar than we needed

to. It had become the
childhood clubhouse we
never had. Weʼd busted
open the storage boxes in
our motherʼs basement one
drunken night last year,
back when she was alive
but right near the end,
when we were in need of
comfort, and we revisited
the toys and games with
much oohing and ahhing
between sips of canned

beer. Christmas in August.
After Mom died, Go moved
into our old house, and we
slowly relocated our toys,
piecemeal, to The Bar: a
Strawberry Shortcake doll,
now scentless, pops up on
a stool one day (my gift to
Go). A tiny Hot Wheels El
Camino,
one
wheel
missing, appears on a shelf
in the corner (Goʼs to me).
We were thinking of

introducing a board game
night, even though most of
our customers were too
old to be nostalgic for our
Hungry Hungry Hippos,
our Game of Life with its
tiny plastic cars to be filled
with tiny plastic pinhead
spouses and tiny plastic
pinhead babies. I couldnʼt
remember how you won.
(Deep Hasbro thought for
the day.)

Go refilled my beer,
refilled her beer. Her left
eyelid drooped slightly. It
was exactly noon, 12:00,
and I wondered how long
sheʼd been drinking. Sheʼs
had a bumpy decade. My
speculative sister, she of
the rocket-science brain
and the rodeo spirit,
dropped out of college and
moved to Manhattan in the
late ʼ90s. She was one of

the
original
dot-com
phenoms—made
crazy
money for two years, then
took the Internet bubble
bath in 2000. Go remained
unflappable.
She
was
closer to twenty than
thirty; she was fine. For
act two, she got her degree
and joined the gray-suited
world
of
investment
banking. She was midlevel,
nothing flashy, nothing

blameful, but she lost her
job—fast—with the 2008
financial
meltdown.
I
didnʼt even know sheʼd
left New York until she
phoned me from Momʼs
house: I give up. I begged
her, cajoled her to return,
hearing
nothing
but
peeved silence on the
other end. After I hung up,
I
made
an
anxious
pilgrimage
to
her

apartment in the Bowery
and saw Gary, her beloved
ficus tree, yellow-dead on
the fire escape, and knew
sheʼd never come back.
The Bar seemed to
cheer her up. She handled
the books, she poured the
beers. She stole from the
tip jar semi-regularly, but
then she did more work
than me. We never talked
about our old lives. We

were Dunnes, and we were
done,
and
strangely
content about it.
“So, what?” Go said,
her usual way of beginning
a conversation.
“Eh.”
“Eh, what? Eh, bad?
You look bad.”
I shrugged a yes; she
scanned my face.
“Amy?” she asked. It
was an easy question. I

shrugged
again—a
confirmation this time, a
whatcha gonna do? shrug.
Go gave me her
amused face, both elbows
on the bar, hands cradling
chin, hunkering down for
an incisive dissection of
my marriage. Go, an
expert panel of one. “What
about her?”
“Bad day. Itʼs just a bad
day.”

“Donʼt let her worry
you.” Go lit a cigarette.
She smoked exactly one a
day. “Women are crazy.”
Go didnʼt consider herself
part
of
the
general
category of women, a word
she used derisively.
I blew Goʼs smoke back
to its owner. “Itʼs our
anniversary today. Five
years.”
“Wow.”
My
sister

cocked her head back.
Sheʼd been a bridesmaid,
all
in
violet—“the
gorgeous,
raven-haired,
amethyst-draped
dame,”
Amyʼs mother had dubbed
her—but
anniversaries
werenʼt something sheʼd
remember. “Jeez. Fuck.
Dude. That came fast.” She
blew more smoke toward
me, a lazy game of cancer
catch. “She going to do

one of her, uh, what do
you call it, not scavenger
hunt—”
“Treasure hunt,” I said.
My wife loved games,
mostly mind games, but
also actual games of
amusement, and for our
anniversary she always set
up an elaborate treasure
hunt, with each clue
leading to the hiding place
of the next clue until I

reached the end, and my
present. It was what her
dad always did for her
mom on their anniversary,
and donʼt think I donʼt see
the gender roles here, that
I donʼt get the hint. But I
did not grow up in Amyʼs
household, I grew up in
mine, and the last present
I remember my dad giving
my mom was an iron, set
on the kitchen counter, no

wrapping paper.
“Should we make a
wager on how pissed sheʼs
going to get at you this
year?” Go asked, smiling
over the rim of her beer.
The
problem
with
Amyʼs treasure hunts: I
never figured out the
clues.
Our
first
anniversary, back in New
York, I went two for seven.
That was my best year.

The opening parley:
This place is a bit
of a hole in the wall,
But we had a
great kiss there one
Tuesday last fall.
Ever been in a spelling
bee as a kid? That snowy
second
after
the
announcement of the word
as you sift your brain to
see if you can spell it? It
was like that, the blank

panic.
“An Irish bar in a notso-Irish
place,”
Amy
nudged.
I bit the side of my lip,
started a shrug, scanning
our living room as if the
answer might appear. She
gave me another very long
minute.
“We were lost in the
rain,” she said in a voice
that was pleading on the

way to peeved.
I finished the shrug.
“McMannʼs,
Nick.
Remember, when we got
lost in the rain in
Chinatown trying to find
that dim sum place, and it
was supposed to be near
the statue of Confucius but
it turns out there are two
statues of Confucius, and
we ended up at that
random Irish bar all

soaking wet, and we
slammed a few whiskeys,
and you grabbed me and
kissed me, and it was—”
“Right! You should
have done a clue with
Confucius, I would have
gotten that.”
“The statue wasnʼt the
point. The place was the
point. The moment. I just
thought it was special.”
She said these last words

in a childish lilt that I once
found fetching.
“It was special.” I
pulled her to me and
kissed her. “That smooch
right there was my special
anniversary reenactment.
Letʼs go do it again at
McMannʼs.”
At
McMannʼs,
the
bartender, a big, bearded
bear-kid, saw us come in
and grinned, poured us

both whiskeys, and pushed
over the next clue.
When Iʼm down
and feeling blue
Thereʼs only one
place that will do.
That one turned out to
be
the
Alice
in
Wonderland
statue
at
Central Park, which Amy
had told me—sheʼd told
me, she knew sheʼd told
me many times—lightened

her moods as a child. I do
not remember any of those
conversations. Iʼm being
honest here, I just donʼt. I
have a dash of ADD, and
Iʼve always found my wife
a bit dazzling, in the
purest sense of the word:
to lose clear vision,
especially from looking at
bright light. It was enough
to be near her and hear
her talk, it didnʼt always

matter what she was
saying. It should have, but
it didnʼt.
By the time we got to
the end of the day, to
exchanging our actual
presents—the traditional
paper presents for the first
year of marriage—Amy
was not speaking to me.
“I love you, Amy. You
know I love you,” I said,
tailing her in and out of

the family packs of dazed
tourists parked in the
middle of the sidewalk,
oblivious
and
openmouthed. Amy was
slipping
through
the
Central
Park
crowds,
maneuvering
between
laser-eyed joggers and
scissor-legged
skaters,
kneeling
parents
and
toddlers careering like
drunks, always just ahead

of
me,
tight-lipped,
hurrying nowhere. Me
trying to catch up, grab
her arm. She stopped
finally, gave me a face
unmoved as I explained
myself, one mental finger
tamping
down
my
exasperation:
“Amy,
I
donʼt get why I need to
prove my love to you by
remembering the exact
same things you do, the

exact same way you do. It
doesnʼt mean I donʼt love
our life together.”
A nearby clown blew
up a balloon animal, a
man bought a rose, a child
licked an ice cream cone,
and a genuine tradition
was born, one Iʼd never
forget: Amy always going
overboard, me never, ever
worthy of the effort.
Happy
anniversary,

asshole.
“Iʼm
guessing—five
years—sheʼs going to get
really
pissed,”
Go
continued. “So I hope you
got her a really good
present.”
“On the to-do list.”
“Whatʼs
the,
like,
symbol, for five years?
Paper?”
“Paper is first year,” I
said. At the end of Year

Oneʼs
unexpectedly
wrenching treasure hunt,
Amy presented me with a
set of posh stationery, my
initials embossed at the
top, the paper so creamy I
expected my fingers to
come away moist. In
return, Iʼd presented my
wife with a bright red
dime-store paper kite,
picturing the park, picnics,
warm
summer
gusts.

Neither of us liked our
presents; weʼd each have
preferred the otherʼs. It
was a reverse O. Henry.
“Silver?” guessed Go.
“Bronze? Scrimshaw? Help
me out.”
“Wood,” I said. “Thereʼs
no romantic present for
wood.”
At the other end of the
bar, Sue neatly folded her
newspaper and left it on

the bartop with her empty
mug and a five-dollar bill.
We all exchanged silent
smiles as she walked out.
“I got it,” Go said. “Go
home, fuck her brains out,
then smack her with your
penis and scream, ʻThereʼs
some wood for you,
bitch!ʼ ”
We laughed. Then we
both flushed pink in our
cheeks in the same spot. It

was the kind of raunchy,
unsisterly joke that Go
enjoyed tossing at me like
a grenade. It was also the
reason why, in high
school, there were always
rumors that we secretly
screwed. Twincest. We
were too tight: our inside
jokes, our edge-of-theparty whispers. Iʼm pretty
sure I donʼt need to say
this, but you are not Go,

you might misconstrue, so
I will: My sister and I have
never screwed or even
thought of screwing. We
just really like each other.
Go
was
now
pantomiming
dickslapping my wife.
No, Amy and Go were
never going to be friends.
They were each too
territorial. Go was used to
being the alpha girl in my

life, Amy was used to
being the alpha girl in
everyoneʼs life. For two
people who lived in the
same city—the same city
twice: first New York, now
here—they barely knew
each other. They flitted in
and out of my life like
well-timed stage actors,
one going out the door as
the other came in, and on
the rare occasions when

they both inhabited the
same room, they seemed
somewhat bemused at the
situation.
Before Amy and I got
serious, got engaged, got
married, I would get
glimpses of Goʼs thoughts
in a sentence here or there.
Itʼs funny, I canʼt quite get a
bead on her, like who she
really is. And: You just seem
kind of not yourself with

her.
And:
Thereʼs
a
difference between really
loving someone and loving
the idea of her. And finally:
The important thing is she
makes you really happy.
Back when Amy made
me really happy.
Amy offered her own
notions of Go: Sheʼs
very … Missouri, isnʼt she?
And: You just have to be in
the right mood for her. And:

Sheʼs a little needy about
you, but then I guess she
doesnʼt have anyone else.
Iʼd hoped when we all
wound
up
back
in
Missouri, the two would
let it drop—agree to
disagree, free to be you
and me. Neither did. Go
was funnier than Amy,
though, so it was a
mismatched battle. Amy
was clever, withering,

sarcastic. Amy could get
me riled up, could make
an excellent, barbed point,
but Go always made me
laugh. It is dangerous to
laugh at your spouse.
“Go, I thought we
agreed
youʼd
never
mention
my
genitalia
again,” I said. “That within
the bounds of our sibling
relationship, I have no
genitalia.”

The phone rang. Go
took one more sip of her
beer and answered, gave
an eyeroll and a smile. “He
sure is here, one moment,
please!” To me, she
mouthed: “Carl.”
Carl Pelley lived across
the street from me and
Amy. Retired three years.
Divorced
two
years.
Moved
into
our
development right after.

Heʼd been a traveling
salesman—childrenʼs party
supplies—and I sensed that
after four decades of motel
living, he wasnʼt quite at
home being home. He
showed up at the bar
nearly every day with a
pungent Hardeeʼs bag,
complaining about his
budget until he was
offered a first drink on the
house. (This was another

thing I learned about Carl
from his days in The Bar—
that he was a functioning
but serious alcoholic.) He
had the good grace to
accept whatever we were
“trying to get rid of,” and
he meant it: For one full
month Carl drank nothing
but dusty Zimas, circa
1992, that weʼd discovered
in the basement. When a
hangover kept Carl home,

heʼd find a reason to call:
Your mailbox looks awfully
full today, Nicky, maybe a
package came. Or: Itʼs
supposed to rain, you might
want to close your windows.
The reasons were bogus.
Carl just needed to hear
the clink of glasses, the
glug of a drink being
poured.
I picked up the phone,
shaking a tumbler of ice

near the receiver so Carl
could imagine his gin.
“Hey, Nicky,” Carlʼs
watery voice came over.
“Sorry to bother you. I just
thought
you
should
know … your door is wide
open, and that cat of yours
is outside. It isnʼt supposed
to be, right?”
I gave a noncommittal
grunt.
“Iʼd go over and check,

but Iʼm a little under the
weather,”
Carl
said
heavily.
“Donʼt worry,” I said.
“Itʼs time for me to go
home anyway.”
It was a fifteen-minute
drive, straight north along
River Road. Driving into
our
development
occasionally makes me
shiver, the sheer number
of gaping dark houses—

homes that have never
known inhabitants, or
homes that have known
owners and seen them
ejected, the house standing
triumphantly
voided,
humanless.
When Amy and I
moved
in,
our
only
neighbors descended on
us: one middle-aged single
mom of three, bearing a
casserole; a young father

of triplets with a six-pack
of beer (his wife left at
home with the triplets); an
older Christian couple who
lived a few houses down;
and of course, Carl from
across the street. We sat
out on our back deck and
watched the river, and
they all talked ruefully
about ARMs, and zero
percent interest, and zero
money down, and then

they all remarked how
Amy and I were the only
ones with river access, the
only
ones
without
children. “Just the two of
you? In this whole big
house?” the single mom
asked,
doling
out
a
scrambled-egg something.
“Just the two of us,” I
confirmed with a smile,
and
nodded
in
appreciation as I took a

mouthful of wobbly egg.
“Seems lonely.”
On that she was right.
Four months later, the
whole big house lady lost
her mortgage battle and
disappeared in the night
with her three kids. Her
house
has
remained
empty. The living-room
window still has a childʼs
picture of a butterfly taped
to it, the bright Magic

Marker
sun-faded
to
brown. One evening not
long ago, I drove past and
saw a man, bearded,
bedraggled, staring out
from behind the picture,
floating in the dark like
some sad aquarium fish.
He saw me see him and
flickered back into the
depths of the house. The
next day I left a brown
paper
bag
full
of

sandwiches on the front
step; it sat in the sun
untouched for a week,
decaying wetly, until I
picked it back up and
threw it out.
Quiet. The complex
was always disturbingly
quiet. As I neared our
home, conscious of the
noise of the car engine, I
could see the cat was
definitely on the steps.

Still on the steps, twenty
minutes after Carlʼs call.
This was strange. Amy
loved the cat, the cat was
declawed, the cat was
never let outside, never
ever, because the cat,
Bleecker, was sweet but
extremely
stupid,
and
despite
the
LoJack
tracking device pelleted
somewhere in his fat furry
rolls, Amy knew sheʼd

never see the cat again if
he ever got out. The cat
would waddle straight into
the Mississippi River—
deedle-de-dum—and float
all the way to the Gulf of
Mexico into the maw of a
hungry bull shark.
But it turned out the
cat wasnʼt even smart
enough to get past the
steps.
Bleecker
was
perched on the edge of the

porch, a pudgy but proud
sentinel—Private Tryhard.
As I pulled in to the drive,
Carl came out and stood
on his own front steps, and
I could feel the cat and the
old man both watching me
as I got out of the car and
walked toward the house,
the red peonies along the
border looking fat and
juicy,
asking
to
be
devoured.

I was about to go into
blocking position to get
the cat when I saw that the
front door was open. Carl
had said as much, but
seeing it was different.
This wasnʼt taking-out-thetrash-back-in-a-minute
open. This was widegaping-ominous open.
Carl hovered across the
way, waiting for my
response, and like some

awful
piece
of
performance art, I felt
myself enacting Concerned
Husband. I stood on the
middle step and frowned,
then took the stairs
quickly, two at a time,
calling out my wifeʼs
name.
Silence.
“Amy, you home?”
I ran straight upstairs.
No Amy. The ironing

board was set up, the iron
still on, a dress waiting to
be pressed.
“Amy!”
As
I
ran
back
downstairs, I could see
Carl still framed in the
open doorway, hands on
hips, watching. I swerved
into the living room, and
pulled up short. The carpet
glinted with shards of
glass, the coffee table

shattered. End tables were
on their sides, books slid
across the floor like a card
trick. Even the heavy
antique ottoman was bellyup, its four tiny feet in the
air like something dead. In
the middle of the mess was
a pair of good sharp
scissors.
“Amy!”
I
began
running,
bellowing
her
name.

Through
the
kitchen,
where a teakettle was
burning, down to the
basement, where the guest
room stood empty, and
then out the back door. I
pounded across our yard
onto the slender boat deck
leading out over the river.
I peeked over the side to
see if she was in our
rowboat, where I had
found
her
one
day,

tethered to the dock,
rocking in the water, her
face to the sun, eyes
closed, and as Iʼd peered
down into the dazzling
reflections of the river, at
her beautiful, still face,
sheʼd suddenly opened her
blue eyes and said nothing
to me, and Iʼd said nothing
back and gone into the
house alone.
“Amy!”

She wasnʼt on the
water, she wasnʼt in the
house. Amy was not there.
Amy was gone.

AMY ELLIOTT
SEPTEMBER 18,
2005

DIARY ENTRY

Well, well, well. Guess
whoʼs back? Nick Dunne,
Brooklyn party boy, sugar-

cloud kisser, disappearing
act. Eight months, two
weeks, couple of days, no
word,
and
then
he
resurfaces, like it was all
part of the plan. Turns out,
heʼd lost my phone
number. His cell was out
of juice, so heʼd written it
on a stickie. Then heʼd
tucked the stickie into his
jeans pocket and put the
jeans in the washer, and it

turned the stickie into a
piece of cyclone-shaped
pulp. He tried to unravel it
but could only see a 3 and
an 8. (He said.)
And
then
work
clobbered
him
and
suddenly it was March and
too embarrassingly late to
try to find me. (He said.)
Of course I was angry. I
had been angry. But now
Iʼm not. Let me set the

scene. (She said.) Today.
Gusty September winds.
Iʼm walking along Seventh
Avenue,
making
a
lunchtime contemplation
of the sidewalk bodega
bins—endless
plastic
containers of cantaloupe
and honeydew and melon
perched on ice like the
dayʼs catch—and I could
feel a man barnacling
himself to my side as I

sailed along, and I cornereyed the intruder and
realized who it was. It was
him. The boy in “I met a
boy!”
I didnʼt break my
stride, just turned to him
and said:
a) “Do I
know
you?”
(manipulative,
challenging)
b) “Oh,

wow,
Iʼm
so
happy
to
see
you!”
(eager,
doormatlike)
c) “Go fuck
yourself.”
(aggressive,
bitter)
d) “Well,
you certainly take
your time about
it, donʼt you,
Nick?”
(light,

playful, laid-back)
Answer: D
And
now
weʼre
together.
Together,
together. It was that easy.
Itʼs interesting, the timing.
Propitious, if you will.
(And I will.) Just last night
was my parentsʼ book
party. Amazing Amy and
the Big Day. Yup, Rand and
Marybeth couldnʼt resist.
Theyʼve
given
their

daughterʼs namesake what
they canʼt give their
daughter: a husband! Yes,
for book twenty, Amazing
Amy is getting married!
Wheeeeeee. No one cares.
No one wanted Amazing
Amy to grow up, least of
all me. Leave her in
kneesocks and hair ribbons
and let me grow up,
unencumbered
by
my
literary alter ego, my

paper-bound better half,
the me I was supposed to
be.
But Amy is the Elliott
bread and butter, and sheʼs
served us well, so I
suppose I canʼt begrudge
her a perfect match. Sheʼs
marrying good old Able
Andy, of course. Theyʼll be
just like my parents:
happy-happy.
Still, it was unsettling,

the incredibly small order
the publisher put in. A
new Amazing Amy used to
get a first print of a
hundred thousand copies
back in the ʼ80s. Now ten
thousand. The book-launch
party was, accordingly,
unfabulous. Off-tone. How
do you throw a party for a
fictional character who
started life as a precocious
moppet of six and is now a

thirty-year-old bride-to-be
who still speaks like a
child? (“Sheesh,” thought
Amy, “my dear fiancé sure
is a grouch-monster when he
doesnʼt get his way …” That
is an actual quote. The
whole book made me want
to punch Amy right in her
stupid, spotless vagina.)
The book is a nostalgia
item, intended to be
purchased by women who

grew up with Amazing
Amy, but Iʼm not sure who
will actually want to read
it. I read it, of course. I
gave the book my blessing
—multiple times. Rand
and Marybeth feared that I
might take Amyʼs marriage
as some jab at my
perpetually single state.
(“I, for one, donʼt think
women
should
marry
before thirty-five,” said my

mom, who married my
dad at twenty-three.)
My
parents
have
always worried that Iʼd
take Amy too personally—
they always tell me not to
read too much into her.
And yet I canʼt fail to
notice that whenever I
screw something up, Amy
does it right: When I
finally quit violin at age
twelve, Amy was revealed

as a prodigy in the next
book. (“Sheesh, violin can
be hard work, but hard
work is the only way to
get better!”) When I blew
off the junior tennis
championship
at
age
sixteen to do a beach
weekend with friends,
Amy recommitted to the
game. (“Sheesh, I know itʼs
fun to spend time with
friends, but Iʼd be letting

myself and everyone else
down if I didnʼt show up
for the tournament.”) This
used to drive me mad, but
after I went off to Harvard
(and Amy correctly chose
my parentsʼ alma mater), I
decided it was all too
ridiculous to think about.
That my parents, two child
psychologists, chose this
particular public form of
passive-aggressiveness

toward their child was not
just fucked up but also
stupid and weird and kind
of hilarious. So be it.
The book party was as
schizophrenic as the book
—at Bluenight, off Union
Square, one of those
shadowy
salons
with
wingback chairs and art
deco mirrors that are
supposed to make you feel
like a Bright Young Thing.

Gin martinis wobbling on
trays lofted by waiters
with rictus smiles. Greedy
journalists with knowing
smirks and hollow legs,
getting the free buzz
before they go somewhere
better.
My parents circulate
the room hand in hand—
their love story is always
part of the Amazing Amy
story: husband and wife in

mutual creative labor for a
quarter
century.
Soul
mates. They really call
themselves that, which
makes sense, because I
guess they are. I can vouch
for it, having studied
them, little lonely only
child, for many years.
They have no harsh edges
with each other, no spiny
conflicts, they ride through
life like conjoined jellyfish

—expanding
and
contracting instinctively,
filling each otherʼs spaces
liquidly. Making it look
easy, the soul-mate thing.
People say children from
broken homes have it
hard, but the children of
charmed marriages have
their
own
particular
challenges.
Naturally, I have to sit
on some velvety banquette

in the corner of the room,
out of the noise, so I can
give a few interviews to a
sad handful of kid interns
whoʼve gotten stuck with
the
“grab
a
quote”
assignment from their
editors.
How does it feel to see
Amy finally married to
Andy? Because youʼre not
married, right?
Question asked by:

a) a
sheepish,
bugeyed
kid
balancing
a
notebook on top
of his messenger
bag
b) an
overdressed,
sleek-haired
young thing with
fuck-me stilettos
c) an eager,

tattooed
rockabilly
girl
who seemed way
more interested in
Amy than one
would guess a
tattooed
rockabilly
girl
would be
d) all of the
above
Answer: D
Me: “Oh, Iʼm thrilled for

Amy and Andy, I wish them
the best. Ha, ha.”
My answers to all the
other questions, in no
particular order:
“Some parts of Amy are
inspired by me, and some
are just fiction.”
“Iʼm happily single right
now, no Able Andy in my
life!”
“No, I donʼt think Amy
oversimplifies the male-

female dynamic.”
“No, I wouldnʼt say Amy
is dated; I think the series is
a classic.”
“Yes, I am single. No
Able Andy in my life right
now.”
“Why is Amy amazing
and Andyʼs just able? Well,
donʼt you know a lot of
powerful, fabulous women
who settle for regular guys,
Average Joes and Able

Andys? No, just kidding,
donʼt write that.”
“Yes, I am single.”
“Yes, my parents are
definitely soul mates.”
“Yes, I would like that
for myself one day.”
“Yep,
single,
motherfucker.”
Same questions over
and over, and me trying to
pretend theyʼre thoughtprovoking.
And
them

trying to pretend theyʼre
thought-provoking. Thank
God for the open bar.
Then no one else wants
to talk to me—that fast—
and the PR girl pretends
itʼs a good thing: Now you
can get back to your party! I
wriggle back into the
(small) crowd, where my
parents are in full hosting
mode, their faces flushed
—Rand with his toothy

prehistoric-monster-fish
smile, Marybeth with her
chickeny, cheerful head
bobs,
their
hands
intertwined, making each
other laugh, enjoying each
other, thrilled with each
other—and I think, I am so
fucking lonely.
I go home and cry for a
while. I am almost thirtytwo. Thatʼs not old,
especially not in New

York, but fact is, itʼs been
years since I even really
liked someone. So how
likely is it Iʼll meet
someone I love, much less
someone I love enough to
marry? Iʼm tired of not
knowing who Iʼll be with,
or if Iʼll be with anyone.
I have many friends
who are married—not
many who are happily
married, but many married

friends. The few happy
ones are like my parents:
Theyʼre baffled by my
singleness. A smart, pretty,
nice girl like me, a girl
with so many interests and
enthusiasms, a cool job, a
loving family. And letʼs
say it: money. They knit
their
eyebrows
and
pretend to think of men
they can set me up with,
but we all know thereʼs no

one left, no one good left,
and I know that they
secretly
think
thereʼs
something wrong with me,
something hidden away
that
makes
me
unsatisfiable, unsatisfying.
The ones who are not
soul-mated—the ones who
have settled—are even
more dismissive of my
singleness: Itʼs not that
hard to find someone to

marry, they say. No
relationship is perfect,
they say—they, who make
do with dutiful sex and
gassy bedtime rituals, who
settle
for
TV
as
conversation, who believe
that
husbandly
capitulation—yes, honey,
okay, honey—is the same
as concord. Heʼs doing what
you tell him to do because
he doesnʼt care enough to

argue, I think. Your petty
demands simply make him
feel superior, or resentful,
and someday he will fuck his
pretty, young coworker who
asks nothing of him, and
you will actually be shocked.
Give me a man with a
little fight in him, a man
who calls me on my
bullshit. (But who also
kind of likes my bullshit.)
And yet: Donʼt land me in

one of those relationships
where
weʼre
always
pecking at each other,
disguising insults as jokes,
rolling our eyes and
“playfully” scrapping in
front of our friends, hoping
to lure them to our side of
an argument they could
not care less about. Those
awful if only relationships:
This marriage would be
great if only … and you

sense the if only list is a lot
longer than either of them
realizes.
So I know I am right
not to settle, but it doesnʼt
make me feel better as my
friends pair off and I stay
home on Friday night with
a bottle of wine and make
myself an extravagant
meal and tell myself, This
is perfect, as if Iʼm the one
dating me. As I go to

endless rounds of parties
and bar nights, perfumed
and sprayed and hopeful,
rotating myself around the
room like some dubious
dessert. I go on dates with
men who are nice and
good-looking and smart—
perfect-on-paper men who
make me feel like Iʼm in a
foreign land, trying to
explain myself, trying to
make
myself
known.

Because isnʼt that the point
of every relationship: to be
known by someone else, to
be understood? He gets me.
She gets me. Isnʼt that the
simple magic phrase?
So you suffer through
the night with the perfecton-paper man—the stutter
of jokes misunderstood,
the witty remarks lobbed
and missed. Or maybe he
understands that youʼve

made a witty remark but,
unsure of what to do with
it, he holds it in his hand
like
some
bit
of
conversational phlegm he
will wipe away later. You
spend another hour trying
to find each other, to
recognize each other, and
you drink a little too much
and try a little too hard.
And you go home to a cold
bed and think, That was

fine. And your life is a long
line of fine.
And then you run into
Nick Dunne on Seventh
Avenue as youʼre buying
diced cantaloupe, and
pow, you are known, you
are recognized, the both of
you. You both find the
exact same things worth
remembering. (Just one
olive, though.) You have the
same rhythm. Click. You

just know each other. All
of a sudden you see reading
in bed and waffles on
Sunday and laughing at
nothing and his mouth on
yours. And itʼs so far
beyond fine that you know
you can never go back to
fine. That fast. You think:
Oh, here is the rest of my
life. Itʼs finally arrived.

NICK DUNNE
THE DAY OF

I waited for the police
first in the kitchen, but the
acrid smell of the burnt
teakettle was curling up in
the back of my throat,

underscoring my need to
retch, so I drifted out on
the front porch, sat on the
top stair, and willed myself
to be calm. I kept trying
Amyʼs cell, and it kept
going to voice mail, that
quick-clip
cadence
swearing sheʼd phone right
back. Amy always phoned
right back. It had been
three hours, and Iʼd left
five messages, and Amy

had not phoned back.
I didnʼt expect her to.
Iʼd tell the police: Amy
would never have left the
house with the teakettle
on. Or the door open. Or
anything waiting to be
ironed. The woman got
shit done, and she was not
one to abandon a project
(say,
her
fixer-upper
husband, for instance),
even if she decided she

didnʼt like it. Sheʼd made a
grim figure on the Fiji
beach during our twoweek honeymoon, battling
her way through a million
mystical pages of The
Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,
casting pissy glances at me
as I devoured thriller after
thriller. Since our move
back to Missouri, the loss
of her job, her life had
revolved
(devolved?)

around the completion of
endless
tiny,
inconsequential projects.
The dress would have been
ironed.
And there was the
living room, signs pointing
to a struggle. I already
knew Amy wasnʼt phoning
back. I wanted the next
part to start.
It was the best time of
day, the July sky cloudless,

the slowly setting sun a
spotlight on the east,
turning everything golden
and lush, a Flemish
painting. The police rolled
up. It felt casual, me
sitting on the steps, an
evening bird singing in the
tree, these two cops
getting out of their car at a
leisurely pace, as if they
were dropping by a
neighborhood picnic. Kid

cops,
mid-twenties,
confident and uninspired,
accustomed to soothing
worried parents of curfewbusting teens. A Hispanic
girl, her hair in a long dark
braid, and a black guy
with a marineʼs stance.
Carthage had become a bit
(a very tiny bit) less
Caucasian while I was
away, but it was still so
severely segregated that

the only people of color I
saw in my daily routine
tended to be occupational
roamers: delivery men,
medics, postal workers.
Cops. (“This place is so
white, itʼs disturbing,” said
Amy, who, back in the
melting pot of Manhattan,
counted a single AfricanAmerican
among
her
friends. I accused her of
craving ethnic window

dressing, minorities as
backdrops. It did not go
well.)
“Mr.
Dunne?
Iʼm
Officer Velásquez,” said
the woman, “and this is
Officer
Riordan.
We
understand
youʼre
concerned about your
wife?”
Riordan looked down
the road, sucking on a
piece of candy. I could see

his eyes follow a darting
bird out over the river.
Then he snapped his gaze
back toward me, his curled
lips telling me he saw
what everyone else did. I
have a face you want to
punch: Iʼm a working-class
Irish kid trapped in the
body of a total trust-fund
douchebag. I smile a lot to
make up for my face, but
this only sometimes works.

In college, I even wore
glasses for a bit, fake
spectacles with clear lenses
that I thought would lend
me
an
affable,
unthreatening vibe. “You
do realize that makes you
even more of a dick?” Go
reasoned. I threw them out
and smiled harder.
I waved in the cops:
“Come inside the house
and see.”

The two climbed the
steps, accompanied by the
squeaking and shuffling
noises of their belts and
guns. I stood in the entry
to the living room and
pointed at the destruction.
“Oh,”
said
Officer
Riordan, and gave a brisk
crack of his knuckles. He
suddenly
looked
less
bored.
Riordan and Velásquez

leaned forward in their
seats at the dining room
table as they asked me all
the initial questions: who,
where, how long. Their
ears were literally pricked.
A call had been made out
of
my
hearing,
and
Riordan informed me that
detectives
were
being
dispatched. I had the grave
pride of being taken
seriously.

Riordan was asking me
for the second time if Iʼd
seen any strangers in the
neighborhood lately, was
reminding me for the third
time about Carthageʼs
roving bands of homeless
men, when the phone
rang. I launched myself
across the room and
grabbed it.
A surly womanʼs voice:
“Mr.
Dunne,
this
is

Comfort
Hill
Assisted
Living.” It was where Go
and
I
boarded
our
Alzheimerʼs-riddled father.
“I canʼt talk right now,
Iʼll call you back,” I
snapped, and hung up. I
despised the women who
staffed
Comfort
Hill:
unsmiling, uncomforting.
Underpaid,
gruelingly
underpaid, which was
probably why they never

smiled or comforted. I
knew my anger toward
them was misdirected—it
absolutely infuriated me
that my father lingered on
while my mom was in the
ground.
It was Goʼs turn to send
the check. I was pretty
sure it was Goʼs turn for
July. And Iʼm sure she was
positive it was mine. Weʼd
done this before. Go said

we must be mutually
subliminally forgetting to
mail those checks, that
what we really wanted to
forget was our dad.
I was telling Riordan
about the strange man Iʼd
seen in our neighborʼs
vacated house when the
doorbell
rang.
The
doorbell rang. It sounded
so normal, like I was
expecting a pizza.

The two detectives
entered with end-of-shift
weariness. The man was
rangy and thin, with a face
that tapered severely into
a dribble of a chin. The
woman was surprisingly
ugly—brazenly,
beyond
the scope of everyday
ugly: tiny round eyes set
tight as buttons, a long
twist of a nose, skin
spackled with tiny bumps,

long lank hair the color of
a dust bunny. I have an
affinity for ugly women. I
was raised by a trio of
women who were hard on
the
eyes—my
grandmother, my mom,
her sister—and they were
all smart and kind and
funny and sturdy, good,
good women. Amy was the
first pretty girl I ever
dated, really dated.

The ugly woman spoke
first, an echo of Miss
Officer Velásquez. “Mr.
Dunne?
Iʼm
Detective
Rhonda Boney. This is my
partner, Detective Jim
Gilpin. We understand
there are some concerns
about your wife.”
My stomach growled
loud enough for us all to
hear it, but we pretended
we didnʼt.

“We take a look
around, sir?” Gilpin said.
He had fleshy bags under
his eyes and scraggly
white whiskers in his
mustache. His shirt wasnʼt
wrinkled, but he wore it
like it was; he looked like
he
should
stink
of
cigarettes and sour coffee,
even though he didnʼt. He
smelled like Dial soap.
I led them a few short

steps to the living room,
pointed once again at the
wreckage, where the two
younger
cops
were
kneeling carefully, as if
waiting to be discovered
doing something useful.
Boney steered me toward a
chair in the dining room,
away from but in view of
the signs of struggle.
Rhonda Boney walked
me through the same

basics Iʼd told Velásquez
and Riordan, her attentive
sparrow eyes on me.
Gilpin squatted down on a
knee, assessing the living
room.
“Have you phoned
friends or family, people
your wife might be with?”
Rhonda Boney asked.
“I … No. Not yet. I
guess I was waiting for you
all.”

“Ah.” She smiled. “Let
me guess: baby of the
family.”
“What?”
“Youʼre the baby.”
“I have a twin sister.” I
sensed
some
internal
judgment being made.
“Why?” Amyʼs favorite
vase was lying on the
floor, intact, bumped up
against the wall. It was a
wedding
present,
a

Japanese masterwork that
Amy put away each week
when our housecleaner
came because she was sure
it would get smashed.
“Just a guess of mine,
why youʼd wait for us:
Youʼre used to someone
else always taking the
lead,” Boney said. “Thatʼs
what my little brother is
like. Itʼs a birth-order
thing.”
She
scribbled

something on a notepad.
“Okay.” I gave an angry
shrug. “Do you need my
sun sign too, or can we get
started?”
Boney smiled at me
kindly, waiting.
“I
waited
to
do
something
because,
I
mean, sheʼs obviously not
with a friend,” I said,
pointing at the disarray in
the living room.

“Youʼve lived here,
what, Mr. Dunne, two
years?” she asked.
“Two years September.”
“Moved from where?”
“New York.”
“City?”
“Yes.”
She pointed upstairs,
asking permission without
asking, and I nodded and
followed
her,
Gilpin
following me.

“I was a writer there,” I
blurted out before I could
stop myself. Even now,
two years back here, and I
couldnʼt bear for someone
to think this was my only
life.
Boney:
“Sounds
impressive.”
Gilpin: “Of what?”
I timed my answer to
my stair climbing: I wrote
for a magazine (step), I

wrote about pop culture
(step)
for
a
menʼs
magazine (step). At the top
of the stairs, I turned to
see Gilpin looking back at
the living room. He
snapped to.
“Pop
culture?”
he
called up as he began
climbing. “What exactly
does that entail?”
“Popular culture,” I
said. We reached the top

of the stairs, Boney
waiting for us. “Movies,
TV, music, but, uh, you
know, not high arts,
nothing
hifalutin.”
I
winced: hifalutin? How
patronizing.
You
two
bumpkins probably need
me
to
translate
my
English, Comma, Educated
East Coast into English,
Comma, Midwest Folksy.
Me do sum scribbling of

stuffs I get in my noggin
after watchinʼ them movinʼ
pitchers!
“She loves movies,”
Gilpin
said,
gesturing
toward
Boney.
Boney
nodded: I do.
“Now I own The Bar,
downtown,” I added. I
taught a class at the junior
college too, but to add that
suddenly felt too needy. I
wasnʼt on a date.

Boney was peering into
the bathroom, halting me
and Gilpin in the hallway.
“The Bar?” she said. “I
know the place. Been
meaning to drop by. Love
the name. Very meta.”
“Sounds like a smart
move,” Gilpin said. Boney
made for the bedroom,
and we followed. “A life
surrounded by beer ainʼt
too bad.”

“Sometimes the answer
is at the bottom of a
bottle,” I said, then winced
again
at
the
inappropriateness.
We
entered
the
bedroom.
Gilpin laughed. “Donʼt I
know that feeling.”
“See how the iron is
still on?” I began.
Boney nodded, opened
the door of our roomy

closet, and walked inside,
flipping on the light,
fluttering
her
latexed
hands over shirts and
dresses as she moved
toward the back. She made
a sudden noise, bent down,
turned around—holding a
perfectly
square
box
covered in elaborate silver
wrapping.
My stomach seized.
“Someoneʼs birthday?”

she asked.
“Itʼs our anniversary.”
Boney and Gilpin both
twitched like spiders and
pretended they didnʼt.
By
the
time
we
returned to the living
room, the kid officers were
gone. Gilpin got down on
his knees, eyeing the
overturned ottoman.
“Uh, Iʼm a little freaked

out, obviously,” I started.
“I donʼt blame you at
all, Nick,” Gilpin said
earnestly. He had pale
blue eyes that jittered in
place, an unnerving tic.
“Can we do something?
To find my wife. I mean,
because sheʼs clearly not
here.”
Boney pointed at the
wedding portrait on the
wall: me in my tux, a

block of teeth frozen on
my face, my arms curved
formally around Amyʼs
waist; Amy, her blond hair
tightly coiled and sprayed,
her veil blowing in the
beach breeze of Cape Cod,
her eyes open too wide
because
she
always
blinked at the last minute
and she was trying so hard
not to blink. The day after
Independence Day, the

sulfur from the fireworks
mingling with the ocean
salt—summer.
The Cape had been
good to us. I remember
discovering several months
in that Amy, my girlfriend,
was also quite wealthy, a
treasured only child of
creative-genius parents. An
icon of sorts, thanks to a
namesake book series that
I
thought
I
could

remember as a kid.
Amazing
Amy.
Amy
explained this to me in
calm, measured tones, as if
I were a patient waking
from a coma. As if sheʼd
had to do it too many
times before and it had
gone badly—the admission
of wealth thatʼs greeted
with too much enthusiasm,
the disclosure of a secret
identity that she herself

didnʼt create.
Amy told me who and
what she was, and then we
went out to the Elliottsʼ
historically
registered
home on Nantucket Sound,
went sailing together, and
I thought: I am a boy from
Missouri, flying across the
ocean with people whoʼve
seen much more than I have.
If I began seeing things now,
living big, I could still not

catch up with them. It
didnʼt make me feel
jealous. It made me feel
content. I never aspired to
wealth or fame. I was not
raised by big-dreamer
parents who pictured their
child as a future president.
I was raised by pragmatic
parents who pictured their
child as a future office
worker of some sort,
making a living of some

sort. To me, it was heady
enough to be in the
Elliottsʼ proximity, to skim
across the Atlantic and
return
to
a
plushly
restored home built in
1822
by
a
whaling
captain, and there to
prepare and eat meals of
organic, healthful foods
whose names I didnʼt
know how to pronounce.
Quinoa.
I
remember

thinking quinoa was a kind
of fish.
So we married on the
beach on a deep blue
summer day, ate and
drank under a white tent
that billowed like a sail,
and a few hours in, I
sneaked Amy off into the
dark, toward the waves,
because I was feeling so
unreal, I believed I had
become merely a shimmer.

The chilly mist on my skin
pulled me back, Amy
pulled me back, toward
the golden glow of the
tent, where the gods were
feasting,
everything
ambrosia.
Our
whole
courtship was just like
that.
Boney leaned in to
examine Amy. “Your wife
is very pretty.”
“She
is,
sheʼs

beautiful,” I said, and felt
my stomach lilt.
“What
anniversary
today?” she asked.
“Five.”
I was jittering from one
foot to another, wanting to
do something. I didnʼt
want them to discuss how
lovely my wife was, I
wanted them to go out and
search for my fucking
wife. I didnʼt say this out

loud, though; I often donʼt
say things out loud, even
when I should. I contain
and compartmentalize to a
disturbing degree: In my
belly-basement
are
hundreds of bottles of
rage, despair, fear, but
youʼd never guess from
looking at me.
“Five, big one. Let me
guess,
reservations
at
Houstonʼs?” Gilpin asked.

It was the only upscale
restaurant in town. You all
really need to try Houstonʼs,
my mom had said when
we moved back, thinking
it was Carthageʼs unique
little secret, hoping it
might please my wife.
“Of course, Houstonʼs.”
It was my fifth lie to
the police. I was just
starting.

AMY ELLIOTT
DUNNE
JULY 5, 2008

DIARY ENTRY

I am fat with love!
Husky
with
ardor!
Morbidly
obese
with
devotion! A happy, busy
bumblebee
of
marital

enthusiasm. I positively
hum around him, fussing
and fixing. I have become
a strange thing. I have
become a wife. I find
myself steering the ship of
conversations—bulkily,
unnaturally—just so I can
say his name aloud. I have
become a wife, I have
become a bore, I have
been asked to forfeit my
Independent
Young

Feminist card. I donʼt care.
I balance his checkbook, I
trim his hair. Iʼve gotten so
retro, at one point I will
probably use the word
pocketbook, shuffling out
the door in my swingy
tweed coat, my lips
painted red, on the way to
the beauty parlor. Nothing
bothers me. Everything
seems like it will turn out
fine,
every
bother

transformed
into
an
amusing story to be told
over dinner. So I killed a
hobo
today,
honey … hahahaha! Ah, we
have fun!
Nick is like a good stiff
drink: He gives everything
the correct perspective.
Not a different perspective,
the correct perspective.
With Nick, I realize it
actually, truly doesnʼt

matter if the electricity bill
is a few days late, if my
latest quiz turns out a little
lame. (My most recent, Iʼm
not joking: “What kind of
tree would you be?” Me,
Iʼm an apple tree! This
means nothing!) It doesnʼt
matter if the new Amazing
Amy book has been well
and duly scorched, the
reviews vicious, the sales a
stunning plummet after a

limp start. It doesnʼt
matter what color I paint
our room, or how late
traffic makes me, or
whether our recycling
really, truly does get
recycled. (Just level with
me, New York, does it?) It
doesnʼt matter, because I
have found my match. Itʼs
Nick, laid-back and calm,
smart
and
fun
and
uncomplicated.

Untortured, happy. Nice.
Big penis.
All the stuff I donʼt like
about myself has been
pushed to the back of my
brain. Maybe that is what I
like best about him, the
way he makes me. Not
makes me feel, just makes
me. I am fun. I am playful.
I am game. I feel naturally
happy
and
entirely
satisfied. I am a wife! Itʼs

weird to say those words.
(Seriously,
about
the
recycling, New York—
come on, just a wink.)
We do silly things, like
last weekend we drove to
Delaware because neither
of us have ever had sex in
Delaware. Let me set the
scene, because now it
really is for posterity. We
cross
the
state
line
—Welcome to Delaware!,

the sign says, and also:
Small Wonder, and also:
The First State, and also:
Home of Tax-Free Shopping.
Delaware, a state of
many rich identities.
I point Nick down the
first dirt road I see, and we
rumble five minutes until
we hit pine trees on all
sides. We donʼt speak. He
pushes his seat back. I pull
up my skirt. I am not

wearing undies, I can see
his mouth turn down and
his face go slack, the
drugged, determined look
he gets when heʼs turned
on. I climb atop him, my
back to him, facing the
windshield. Iʼm pressed
against the steering wheel,
and as we move together,
the horn emits tiny bleats
that mimic me, and my
hand makes a smearing

noise as I press it against
the windshield. Nick and I
can
come
anywhere;
neither of us gets stage
fright, itʼs something weʼre
both rather proud of. Then
we drive right back home.
I eat beef jerky and ride
with bare feet on the
dashboard.
We love our house. The
house that Amazing Amy
built.
A
Brooklyn

brownstone my parents
bought for us, right on the
Promenade, with the big
wide-screen
view
of
Manhattan.
Itʼs
extravagant, it makes me
feel guilty, but itʼs perfect.
I battle the spoiled-richgirl vibe where I can. Lots
of DIY. We painted the
walls ourselves over two
weekends: spring green
and pale yellow and

velvety blue. In theory.
None of the colors turned
out like we thought they
would, but we pretend to
like them anyway. We fill
our
home
with
knickknacks from flea
markets; we buy records
for Nickʼs record player.
Last night we sat on the
old Persian rug, drinking
wine and listening to the
vinyl scratches as the sky

went dark and Manhattan
switched on, and Nick
said, “This is how I always
pictured it. This is exactly
how I pictured it.”
On weekends, we talk
to each other under four
layers of bedding, our
faces warm under a sunlit
yellow comforter. Even the
floorboards are cheerful:
There are two old creaky
slats that call out to us as

we walk in the door. I love
it, I love that it is ours,
that we have a great story
behind the ancient floor
lamp, or the misshapen
clay mug that sits near our
coffeepot, never holding
anything but a single
paper clip. I spend my
days thinking of sweet
things to do for him—go
buy a peppermint soap
that will sit in his palm

like a warm stone, or
maybe a slim slice of trout
that I could cook and serve
to him, an ode to his
riverboat days. I know, I
am ridiculous. I love it,
though—I never knew I
was capable of being
ridiculous over a man. Itʼs
a relief. I even swoon over
his socks, which he
manages to shed in
adorably tangled poses, as

if a puppy carried them in
from another room.
It is our one-year
anniversary and I am fat
with love, even though
people kept telling and
telling us the first year was
going to be so hard, as if
we were naive children
marching off to war. It
wasnʼt hard. We are meant
to be married. It is our
one-year anniversary, and

Nick is leaving work at
lunchtime; my treasure
hunt awaits him. The clues
are all about us, about the
past year together:
Whenever my
sweet hubby gets a cold
It is this dish that
will soon be sold.
Answer: the tom yum
soup from Thai Town on
President
Street.
The
manager will be there this

afternoon with a taster
bowl and the next clue.
Also
McMannʼs
in
Chinatown and the Alice
statue at Central Park. A
grand tour of New York.
Weʼll end at the Fulton
Street fish market, where
weʼll buy a pair of
beautiful lobsters, and I
will hold the container in
my lap as Nick jitters
nervously in the cab beside

me. Weʼll rush home, and I
will drop them in a new
pot on our old stove with
all the finesse of a girl who
has lived many Cape
summers
while
Nick
giggles and pretends to
hide in fear outside the
kitchen door.
I had suggested we get
burgers. Nick wanted us to
go out—five-star, fancy—
somewhere
with
a

clockwork of courses and
namedropping waiters. So
the lobsters are a perfect
in-between, the lobsters
are what everyone tells us
(and tells us and tells us)
that marriage is about:
compromise!
Weʼll eat lobster with
butter and have sex on the
floor while a woman on
one of our old jazz records
sings to us in her far-side-

of-the-tunnel voice. Weʼll
get slowly lazy-drunk on
good
Scotch,
Nickʼs
favorite. Iʼll give him his
present—the
monogrammed stationery
heʼs been wanting from
Crane & Co. with the clean
sans-serif font set in hunter
green, on the thick creamy
stock that will hold lush
ink and his writerʼs words.
Stationery for a writer, and

a writerʼs wife whoʼs
maybe angling for a love
letter or two.
Then maybe weʼll have
sex again. And a late-night
burger. And more Scotch.
Voilà: happiest couple on
the block! And they say
marriage is such hard
work.

NICK DUNNE
THE NIGHT OF

Boney
and
Gilpin
moved our interview to
the police station, which
looks
like
a
failing
community bank. They left
me alone in a little room
for forty minutes, me

willing myself not to
move. To pretend to be
calm is to be calm, in a
way. I slouched over the
table, put my chin on my
arm. Waited.
“Do you want to call
Amyʼs parents?” Boney
had asked.
“I donʼt want to panic
them,” I said. “If we donʼt
hear from her in an hour,
Iʼll call.”

Weʼd
done
three
rounds
of
that
conversation.
Finally, the cops came
in and sat at the table
across from me. I fought
the urge to laugh at how
much it felt like a TV
show. This was the same
room Iʼd seen surfing
through late-night cable
for the past ten years, and
the
two
cops—weary,

intense—acted like the
stars. Totally fake. Epcot
Police Station. Boney was
even holding a paper
coffee cup and a manila
folder that looked like a
prop. Cop prop. I felt
giddy, felt for a moment
we were all pretend
people: Letʼs play the
Missing Wife game!
“You okay there, Nick?”
Boney asked.

“Iʼm okay, why?”
“Youʼre smiling.”
The giddiness slid to
the tiled floor. “Iʼm sorry,
itʼs all just—”
“I know,” Boney said,
giving me a look that was
like a hand pat. “Itʼs too
strange, I know.” She
cleared her throat. “First of
all, we want to make sure
youʼre comfortable here.
You need anything, just let

us know. The more
information you can give
us right now, the better,
but you can leave at any
time, thatʼs not a problem
either.”
“Whatever you need.”
“Okay, great, thank
you,” she said. “Um, okay.
I want to get the annoying
stuff out of the way first.
The crap stuff. If your wife
was indeed abducted—and

we donʼt know that, but if
it comes to that—we want
to catch the guy, and when
we catch the guy, we want
to nail him, hard. No way
out. No wiggle room.”
“Right.”
“So we have to rule you
out real quick, real easy.
So the guy canʼt come
back and say we didnʼt
rule you out, you know
what I mean?”

I nodded mechanically.
I didnʼt really know what
she meant, but I wanted to
seem as cooperative as
possible. “Whatever you
need.”
“We donʼt want to
freak you out,” Gilpin
added. “We just want to
cover all the bases.”
“Fine by me.” Itʼs
always the husband, I
thought. Everyone knows

itʼs always the husband, so
why canʼt they just say it:
We suspect you because you
are the husband, and itʼs
always the husband. Just
watch Dateline.
“Okay, great, Nick,”
Boney said. “First letʼs get
a swab of the inside of
your cheek so we can rule
out all of the DNA in the
house that isnʼt yours.
Would that be okay?”

“Sure.”
“Iʼd also like to take a
quick sweep of your hands
for gun shot residue.
Again, just in case—”
“Wait, wait, wait. Have
you found something that
makes you think my wife
was—”
“Nonono, Nick,” Gilpin
interrupted. He pulled a
chair up to the table and
sat on it backward. I

wondered if cops actually
did that. Or did some
clever actor do that, and
then cops began doing it
because theyʼd seen the
actors playing cops do that
and it looked cool?
“Itʼs
just
smart
protocol,”
Gilpin
continued. “We try to
cover every base: Check
your hands, get a swab,
and if we could check out

your car too …”
“Of course. Like I said,
whatever you need.”
“Thank you, Nick. I
really
appreciate
it.
Sometimes
guys,
they
make things hard for us
just because they can.”
I was exactly the
opposite. My father had
infused my childhood with
unspoken blame; he was
the kind of man who

skulked around looking for
things to be angry at. This
had turned Go defensive
and extremely unlikely to
take unwarranted shit. It
had turned me into a kneejerk suckup to authority.
Mom,
Dad,
teachers:
Whatever makes your job
easier, sir or madam. I
craved a constant stream
of
approval.
“Youʼd
literally lie, cheat, and

steal—hell,
kill—to
convince people you are a
good guy,” Go once said.
We were in line for knishes
at Yonah Schimmelʼs, not
far from Goʼs old New
York
apartment—thatʼs
how well I remember the
moment—and I lost my
appetite because it was so
completely true and Iʼd
never realized it, and even
as she was saying it, I

thought: I will never forget
this, this is one of those
moments that will be lodged
in my brain forever.
We made small talk,
the cops and I, about the
July Fourth fireworks and
the weather, while my
hands were tested for
gunshot residue and the
slick inside of my cheek
was
cotton-tipped.
Pretending it was normal,

a trip to the dentist.
When it was done,
Boney put another cup of
coffee in front of me,
squeezed my shoulder.
“Iʼm sorry about that.
Worst part of the job. You
think youʼre up to a few
questions now? Itʼd really
help us.”
“Yes, definitely, fire
away.”
She placed a slim

digital tape recorder on
the table in front of me.
“You mind? This way you
wonʼt have to answer the
same questions over and
over and over …” She
wanted to tape me so Iʼd
be nailed to one story. I
should call a lawyer, I
thought, but only guilty
people need lawyers, so I
nodded: No problem.
“So: Amy,” Boney said.

“You two been living here
how long?”
“Just about two years.”
“And sheʼs originally
from New York. City.”
“Yes.”
“She work, got a job?”
Gilpin said.
“No. She used to write
personality quizzes.”
The detectives swapped
a look: Quizzes?
“For teen magazines,

womenʼs magazines,” I
said. “You know: ʻAre you
the jealous type? Take our
quiz and find out! Do guys
find you too intimidating?
Take our quiz and find
out!ʼ ”
“Very cool, I love
those,” Boney said. “I
didnʼt know that was an
actual job. Writing those.
Like, a career.”
“Well,
itʼs
not.

Anymore. The Internet is
packed with quizzes for
free. Amyʼs were smarter
—she had a masterʼs in
psychology—has
a
masterʼs in psychology.” I
guffawed uncomfortably at
my gaffe. “But smart canʼt
beat free.”
“Then what?”
I shrugged. “Then we
moved back here. Sheʼs
just kind of staying at

home right now.”
“Oh! You guys got kids,
then?” Boney chirped, as if
she had discovered good
news.
“No.”
“Oh. So then what does
she do most days?”
That was my question
too. Amy was once a
woman who did a little of
everything, all the time.
When we moved in

together, sheʼd made an
intense study of French
cooking, displaying hyperquick knife skills and an
inspired
boeuf
bourguignon.
For
her
thirty-fourth birthday, we
flew to Barcelona, and she
stunned me by rolling off
trills of conversational
Spanish, learned in months
of secret lessons. My wife
had a brilliant, popping

brain, a greedy curiosity.
But her obsessions tended
to
be
fueled
by
competition: She needed to
dazzle men and jealous-ify
women: Of course Amy can
cook French cuisine and
speak fluent Spanish and
garden and knit and run
marathons and day-trade
stocks and fly a plane and
look like a runway model
doing it. She needed to be

Amazing Amy, all the
time. Here in Missouri, the
women shop at Target,
they
make
diligent,
comforting meals, they
laugh about how little
high school Spanish they
remember.
Competition
doesnʼt interest them.
Amyʼs relentless achieving
is greeted with openpalmed acceptance and
maybe a bit of pity. It was

about the worst outcome
possible
for
my
competitive wife: a town
of contented also-rans.
“She has a lot of
hobbies,” I said.
“Anything
worrying
you?”
Boney
asked,
looking worried. “Youʼre
not concerned about drugs
or drinking? Iʼm not
speaking ill of your wife. A
lot of housewives, more

than youʼd guess, they
pass the day that way. The
days, they get long when
youʼre by yourself. And if
the drinking turns to drugs
—and Iʼm not talking
heroin
but
even
prescription painkillers—
well, there are some pretty
awful characters selling
around here right now.”
“The drug trade has
gotten bad,” Gilpin said.

“Weʼve had a bunch of
police layoffs—one-fifth of
the force, and we were
tight to begin with. I
mean, itʼs bad, weʼre
overrun.”
“Had a housewife, nice
lady, get a tooth knocked
out last month over some
OxyContin,”
Boney
prompted.
“No, Amy might have a
glass
of
wine
or

something, but not drugs.”
Boney eyed me; this
was clearly not the answer
she wanted. “She have
some good friends here?
Weʼd like to call some of
them, just make sure. No
offense.
Sometimes
a
spouse is the last to know
when drugs are involved.
People
get
ashamed,
especially women.”
Friends. In New York,

Amy made and shed
friends weekly; they were
like her projects. Sheʼd get
intensely excited about
them: Paula who gave her
singing lessons and had a
wicked good voice (Amy
went to boarding school in
Massachusetts; I loved the
very occasional times she
got all New England on
me: wicked good); Jessie
from the fashion-design

course. But then Iʼd ask
about Jessie or Paula a
month later, and Amy
would look at me like I
was making up words.
Then there were the
men who were always
rattling behind Amy, eager
to do the husbandly things
that her husband failed to
do. Fix a chair leg, hunt
down
her
favorite
imported Asian tea. Men

who she swore were her
friends, just good friends.
Amy kept them at exactly
an armʼs distance—far
enough away that I
couldnʼt get too annoyed,
close enough that she
could crook a finger and
theyʼd do her bidding.
In Missouri … good
God, I really didnʼt know.
It only occurred to me just
then. You truly are an

asshole, I thought. Two
years weʼd been here, and
after the initial flurry of
meet-and-greets,
those
manic first months, Amy
had no one she regularly
saw. She had my mom,
who was now dead, and
me—and our main form of
conversation was attack
and rebuttal. When weʼd
been back home for a year,
Iʼd
asked
her
faux

gallantly: “And how are
you liking North Carthage,
Mrs. Dunne?”
“New Carthage, you
mean?” sheʼd replied. I
refused to ask her the
reference, but I knew it
was an insult.
“She has a few good
friends, but theyʼre mostly
back east.”
“Her folks?”
“They live in New

York. City.”
“And you still havenʼt
called
any
of
these
people?” Boney asked, a
bemused smile on her face.
“Iʼve
been
doing
everything else youʼve
been asking me to do. I
havenʼt had a chance.” Iʼd
signed away permission to
trace credit cards and
ATMs and track Amyʼs cell
phone, Iʼd handed over

Goʼs cell number and the
name of Sue, the widow at
The Bar, who could
presumably attest to the
time I arrived.
“Baby of the family.”
She shook her head. “You
really do remind me of my
little brother.” A beat.
“Thatʼs a compliment, I
swear.”
“She dotes on him,”
Gilpin said, scribbling in a

notebook. “Okay, so you
left the house at about
seven-thirty A.M., and you
showed up at The Bar at
about
noon,
and
in
between, you were at the
beach.”
Thereʼs a beachhead
about ten miles north of
our house, a not overly
pleasant collection of sand
and silt and beer-bottle
shards.
Trash
barrels

overflowing
with
Styrofoam cups and dirty
diapers. But there is a
picnic table upwind that
gets nice sun, and if you
stare directly at the river,
you can ignore the other
crap.
“I sometimes bring my
coffee and the paper and
just sit. Gotta make the
most of summer.”
No, I hadnʼt talked to

anyone at the beach. No,
no one saw me.
“Itʼs a quiet place
midweek,” Gilpin allowed.
If the police talked to
anyone who knew me,
theyʼd quickly learn that I
rarely went to the beach
and that I never sometimes
brought my coffee to just
enjoy the morning. I have
Irish-white skin and an
impatience
for
navel-

gazing: A beach boy I am
not. I told the police that
because it had been Amyʼs
idea, for me to go sit in the
spot where I could be
alone and watch the river I
loved and ponder our life
together. Sheʼd said this to
me this morning, after
weʼd eaten her crepes. She
leaned forward on the
table and said, “I know we
are having a tough time. I

still love you so much,
Nick, and I know I have a
lot of things to work on. I
want to be a good wife to
you, and I want you to be
my husband and be happy.
But you need to decide
what you want.”
Sheʼd
clearly
been
practicing the speech; she
smiled proudly as she said
it. And even as my wife
was offering me this

kindness, I was thinking,
Of course she has to stagemanage this. She wants the
image of me and the wild
running river, my hair
ruffling in the breeze as I
look out onto the horizon
and ponder our life together.
I canʼt just go to Dunkinʼ
Donuts.
You need to decide what
you want. Unfortunately
for Amy, I had decided

already.
Boney
looked
up
brightly from her notes:
“Can you tell me what
your wifeʼs blood type is?”
she asked.
“Uh, no, I donʼt know.”
“You donʼt know your
wifeʼs blood type?”
“Maybe O?” I guessed.
Boney frowned, then
made a drawn-out yogalike sound. “Okay, Nick,

here are the things we are
doing to help.” She listed
them: Amyʼs cell was
being
monitored,
her
photo
circulated,
her
credit
cards
tracked.
Known sex offenders in the
area
were
being
interviewed. Our sparse
neighborhood was being
canvassed.
Our
home
phone was tapped, in case
any ransom calls came in.

I wasnʼt sure what to
say now. I raked my
memory for the lines:
What does the husband say
at this point in the movie?
Depends on whether heʼs
guilty or innocent.
“I canʼt say that
reassures me. Are you—is
this an abduction, or a
missing persons case, or
what exactly is going on?”
I knew the statistics, knew

them from the same TV
show I was starring in: If
the first forty-eight hours
didnʼt turn up something
in a case, it was likely to
go unsolved. The first
forty-eight hours were
crucial. “I mean, my wife
is gone. My wife is gone!” I
realized it was the first
time Iʼd said it the way it
should have been said:
panicked and angry. My

dad was a man of infinite
varieties of bitterness,
rage, distaste. In my
lifelong struggle to avoid
becoming
him,
Iʼd
developed an inability to
demonstrate
much
negative emotion at all. It
was another thing that
made me seem like a dick
—my stomach could be all
oiled eels, and you would
get nothing from my face

and less from my words. It
was a constant problem:
too much control or no
control at all.
“Nick, we are taking
this extremely seriously,”
Boney said. “The lab guys
are over at your place as
we speak, and that will
give us more information
to go on. Right now, the
more you can tell us about
your wife, the better. What

is she like?”
The usual husband
phrases came into my
mind: Sheʼs sweet, sheʼs
great, sheʼs nice, sheʼs
supportive.
“What is she like how?”
I asked.
“Give me an idea of her
personality,”
Boney
prompted. “Like, what did
you get her for your
anniversary? Jewelry?”

“I
hadnʼt
gotten
anything quite yet,” I said.
“I was going to do it this
afternoon.” I waited for
her to laugh and say “baby
of the family” again, but
she didnʼt.
“Okay. Well, then, tell
me about her. Is she
outgoing? Is she—I donʼt
know how to say this—is
she New Yorky? Like what
might come off to some as

rude? Might rub people
the wrong way?”
“I donʼt know. Sheʼs
not a never-met-a-stranger
kind of person, but sheʼs
not—not abrasive enough
to make someone … hurt
her.”
This was my eleventh
lie. The Amy of today was
abrasive enough to want to
hurt, sometimes. I speak
specifically of the Amy of

today, who was only
remotely like the woman I
fell in love with. It had
been an awful fairy-tale
reverse
transformation.
Over just a few years, the
old Amy, the girl of the big
laugh and the easy ways,
literally shed herself, a pile
of skin and soul on the
floor, and out stepped this
new, brittle, bitter Amy.
My wife was no longer my

wife but a razor-wire knot
daring me to unloop her,
and I was not up to the job
with my thick, numb,
nervous fingers. Country
fingers. Flyover fingers
untrained in the intricate,
dangerous work of solving
Amy. When Iʼd hold up the
bloody stumps, sheʼd sigh
and turn to her secret
mental notebook on which
she
tallied
all
my

deficiencies, forever noting
disappointments, frailties,
shortcomings.
My
old
Amy, damn, she was fun.
She was funny. She made
me laugh. Iʼd forgotten
that. And she laughed.
From the bottom of her
throat, from right behind
that small finger-shaped
hollow, which is the best
place to laugh from. She
released her grievances

like handfuls of birdseed:
They are there, and they
are gone.
She was not the thing
she became, the thing I
feared most: an angry
woman. I was not good
with angry women. They
brought something out in
me that was unsavory.
“She bossy?” Gilpin
asked. “Take-charge?”
I thought of Amyʼs

calendar, the one that
went three years into the
future, and if you looked a
year ahead, you would
actually
find
appointments:
dermatologist, dentist, vet.
“Sheʼs
a
planner—she
doesnʼt, you know, wing
anything. She likes to
make lists and check
things off. Get things done.
Thatʼs why this doesnʼt

make sense—”
“That can drive you
crazy,”
Boney
said
sympathetically. “If youʼre
not that type. You seem
very B-personality.”
“Iʼm a little more laidback, I guess,” I said. Then
I added the part I was
supposed to add: “We
round each other out.”
I looked at the clock on
the wall, and Boney

touched my hand.
“Hey, why donʼt you go
ahead and give a call to
Amyʼs parents? Iʼm sure
theyʼd appreciate it.”
It was past midnight.
Amyʼs parents went to
sleep at nine P.M.; they
were strangely boastful
about this early bedtime.
Theyʼd be deep asleep by
now, so this would be an
urgent middle-of-the-night

call. Cells went off at 8:45
always, so Rand Elliott
would have to walk from
his bed all the way to the
end of the hall to pick up
the old heavy phone; heʼd
be fumbling with his
glasses, fussy with the
table lamp. Heʼd be telling
himself all the reasons not
to worry about a late-night
phone
call,
all
the
harmless
reasons
the

phone might be ringing.
I dialed twice and hung
up before I let the call ring
through. When I did, it
was Marybeth, not Rand,
who answered, her deep
voice buzzing my ears. Iʼd
only gotten to “Marybeth,
this is Nick” when I lost it.
“What is it, Nick?”
I took a breath.
“Is it Amy? Tell me.”
“I uh—Iʼm sorry I

should have called—”
“Tell me, goddamn it!”
“We c-canʼt find Amy,”
I stuttered.
“You canʼt find Amy?”
“I donʼt know—”
“Amy is missing?”
“We donʼt know that
for sure, weʼre still—”
“Since when?”
“Weʼre not sure. I left
this morning, a little after
seven—”

“And you waited till
now to call us?”
“Iʼm sorry, I didnʼt
want to—”
“Jesus
Christ.
We
played tennis tonight.
Tennis, and we could have
been … My God. Are the
police involved? Youʼve
notified them?”
“Iʼm at the station right
now.”
“Put on whoeverʼs in

charge, Nick. Please.”
Like a kid, I went to
fetch Gilpin. My mommyin-law wants to talk to you.
Phoning the Elliotts
made it official. The
emergency—Amy is gone—
was spreading to the
outside.
I was heading back to
the interview room when I
heard my fatherʼs voice.
Sometimes, in particularly

shameful moments, I heard
his voice in my head. But
this was my fatherʼs voice,
here. His words emerged
in
wet
bubbles
like
something from a rancid
bog. Bitch bitch bitch. My
father, out of his mind,
had taken to flinging the
word at any woman who
even vaguely annoyed
him: bitch bitch bitch. I
peered inside a conference

room, and there he sat on
a bench against the wall.
He had been a handsome
man once, intense and
cleft-chinned.
Jarringly
dreamy was how my aunt
had described him. Now
he sat muttering at the
floor, his blond hair
matted, trousers muddy,
and arms scratched, as if
heʼd fought his way
through a thornbush. A

line of spittle glimmered
down his chin like a snailʼs
trail, and he was flexing
and unflexing arm muscles
that had not yet gone to
seed. A tense female
officer sat next to him, her
lips in an angry pucker,
trying to ignore him: Bitch
bitch bitch I told you bitch.
“Whatʼs going on?” I
asked her. “This is my
father.”

“You got our call?”
“What call?”
“To come get your
father.”
She
overenunciated, as if I
were a dim ten-year-old.
“I— My wife is missing.
Iʼve been here most of the
night.”
She stared at me, not
connecting in the least. I
could see her debating
whether to sacrifice her

leverage and apologize,
inquire. Then my father
started up again, bitch bitch
bitch, and she chose to
keep the leverage.
“Sir, Comfort Hill has
been trying to contact you
all day. Your father
wandered out a fire exit
early this morning. Heʼs
got a few scratches and
scrapes, as you can see,
but no damage. We picked

him up a few hours ago,
walking down River Road,
disoriented. Weʼve been
trying to reach you.”
“Iʼve been right here,” I
said. “Right goddamn next
door, how did no one put
this together?”
Bitch bitch bitch, said
my dad.
“Sir, please donʼt take
that tone with me.”
Bitch bitch bitch.

Boney
ordered
an
officer—male—to
drive
my dad back to the home
so I could finish up with
them. We stood on the
stairs outside the police
station, watched him get
settled into the car, still
muttering. The entire time
he never registered my
presence. When they drove
off, he didnʼt even look
back.

“You guys not close?”
she asked.
“We are the definition
of not close.”
The police finished
with their questions and
hustled me into a squad
car at about two A.M. with
advice to get a good
nightʼs sleep and return at
eleven for a 12-noon press
conference.
I didnʼt ask if I could

go home. I had them take
me to Goʼs, because I knew
sheʼd stay up and have a
drink with me, fix me a
sandwich.
It
was,
pathetically, all I wanted
right then: a woman to fix
me a sandwich and not ask
me any questions.
“You donʼt want to go
look for her?” Go offered
as I ate. “We can drive
around.”

“That seems pointless,”
I said dully. “Where do I
look?”
“Nick, this is really
fucking serious.”
“I know, Go.”
“Act like it, okay,
Lance?
Donʼt
fucking
myuhmyuhmyuh.” It was a
thick-tongued noise, the
noise she always made to
convey my indecisiveness,
accompanied by a dazed

rolling of the eyes and the
dusting off of my legal first
name. No one who has my
face needs to be called
Lance. She handed me a
tumbler of Scotch. “And
drink this, but only this.
You donʼt want to be
hungover
tomorrow.
Where the fuck could she
be? God, I feel sick to my
stomach.”
She
poured
herself a glass, gulped,

then tried to sip, pacing
around
the
kitchen.
“Arenʼt you worried, Nick?
That some guy, like, saw
her on the street and just,
just decided to take her?
Hit her on the head and—”
I started. “Why did you
say hit her on the head,
what the fuck is that?”
“Iʼm sorry, I didnʼt
mean to paint a picture, I
just … I donʼt know, I just

keep thinking. About some
crazy
person.”
She
splashed
some
more
Scotch into her tumbler.
“Speaking of crazy
people,” I said, “Dad got
out again today, they
found
him
wandering
down River Road. Heʼs
back at Comfort now.”
She shrugged: okay. It
was the third time in six
months that our dad had

slipped out. Go was
lighting a cigarette, her
thoughts still on Amy. “I
mean, isnʼt there someone
we can go talk to?” she
asked. “Something we can
do?”
“Jesus, Go! You really
need me to feel more
fucking impotent than I do
right now?” I snapped. “I
have no idea what Iʼm
supposed to be doing.

Thereʼs no ʻWhen Your
Wife Goes Missing 101.ʼ
The police told me I could
leave. I left. Iʼm just doing
what they tell me.”
“Of course you are,”
murmured Go, who had a
long-stymied mission to
turn me into a rebel. It
wouldnʼt take. I was the
kid in high school who
made curfew; I was the
writer
who
hit
my

deadlines, even the fake
ones. I respect rules,
because if you follow
rules, things go smoothly,
usually.
“Fuck, Go, Iʼm back at
the station in a few hours,
okay? Can you please just
be nice to me for a
second?
Iʼm
scared
shitless.”
We had a five-second
staring contest, then Go

filled up my glass one
more time, an apology.
She sat down next to me,
put a hand on my
shoulder.
“Poor Amy,” she said.

AMY ELLIOTT
DUNNE
APRIL 21, 2009

DIARY ENTRY

Poor me. Let me set the
scene: Campbell and Insley
and I are all down in Soho,
having dinner at Tableau.
Lots of goat-cheese tarts,

lamb meatballs, and rocket
greens, Iʼm not sure what
all the fuss is about. But
we are working backward:
dinner first, then drinks in
one of the little nooks
Campbell has reserved, a
mini-closet where you can
lounge expensively in a
place thatʼs not too
different from, say, your
living room. But fine, itʼs
fun to do the silly, trendy

things sometimes. We are
all overdressed in our little
flashy frocks, our slasher
heels, and we all eat small
plates of food bites that
are as decorative and
unsubstantial as we are.
Weʼve discussed having
our husbands drop by to
join us for the drinks
portion. So there we are,
post-dinner, tucked into
our nook, mojitos and

martinis and my bourbon
delivered to us by a
waitress who could be
auditioning for the small
role of Fresh-faced Girl
Just Off the Bus.
We are running out of
things to say; it is a
Tuesday, and no one is
feeling like it is anything
but. The drinks are being
carefully drunk: Insley and
Campbell both have vague

appointments the next
morning, and I have work,
so we arenʼt gearing up for
a big night, we are
winding down, and we are
getting dull-witted, bored.
We would leave if we
werenʼt waiting for the
possible appearance of the
men.
Campbell
keeps
peeking at her BlackBerry,
Insley studies her flexed
calves
from
different

angles. John arrives first—
huge
apologies
to
Campbell, big smiles and
kisses for us all, a man just
thrilled to be here, just
delighted to arrive at the
tail-end of a cocktail hour
across town so he can
guzzle a drink and head
home with his wife.
George shows up about
twenty minutes later—
sheepish, tense, a terse

excuse about work, Insley
snapping at him, “Youʼre
forty minutes late,” him
nipping back, “Yeah, sorry
about making us money.”
The two barely talking to
each other as they make
conversation
with
everyone else.
Nick never shows; no
call. We wait another
forty-five
minutes,
Campbell
solicitous

(“Probably got hit with
some
last-minute
deadline,” she says, and
smiles toward good old
John, who never lets lastminute deadlines interfere
with his wifeʼs plans);
Insleyʼs anger thawing
toward her husband as she
realizes he is only the
second-biggest jackass of
the group (“You sure he
hasnʼt
even
texted,

sweetie?”).
Me, I just smile: “Who
knows where he is—Iʼll
catch him at home.” And
then it is the men of the
group who look stricken:
You mean that was an
option? Take a pass on the
night
with
no
nasty
consequences? No guilt or
anger or sulking?
Well, maybe not for
you guys.

Nick
and
I,
we
sometimes laugh, laugh
out loud, at the horrible
things women make their
husbands do to prove their
love. The pointless tasks,
the myriad sacrifices, the
endless small surrenders.
We call these men the
dancing monkeys.
Nick will come home,
sweaty and salty and beerloose from a day at the

ballpark, and Iʼll curl up in
his lap, ask him about the
game, ask him if his friend
Jack had a good time, and
heʼll say, “Oh, he came
down with a case of the
dancing
monkeys—poor
Jennifer was having a ʻreal
stressful weekʼ and really
needed him at home.”
Or his buddy at work,
who canʼt go out for drinks
because
his
girlfriend

really needs him to stop by
some bistro where she is
having dinner with a
friend from out of town.
So they can finally meet.
And so she can show how
obedient her monkey is:
He comes when I call, and
look how well groomed!
Wear this, donʼt wear
that. Do this chore now and
do this chore when you get a
chance and by that I mean

now.
And
definitely,
definitely, give up the things
you love for me, so I will
have proof that you love me
best. Itʼs the female pissing
contest—as
we
swan
around our book clubs and
our cocktail hours, there
are few things women love
more than being able to
detail the sacrifices our
men make for us. A calland-response, the response

being: “Ohhh, thatʼs so
sweet.”
I am happy not to be in
that club. I donʼt partake, I
donʼt get off on emotional
coercion, on forcing Nick
to play some happy-hubby
role—the
shrugging,
cheerful, dutiful taking out
the trash, honey! role.
Every wifeʼs dream man,
the counterpoint to every
manʼs fantasy of the sweet,

hot, laid-back woman who
loves sex and a stiff drink.
I like to think I am
confident and secure and
mature enough to know
Nick loves me without him
constantly proving it. I
donʼt
need
pathetic
dancing-monkey scenarios
to repeat to my friends; I
am content with letting
him be himself.
I donʼt know why

women find that so hard.
When I get home from
dinner, my cab pulls up
just as Nick is getting out
of his own taxi, and he
stands in the street with
his arms out to me and a
huge grin on his face
—“Baby!”—and I run and I
jump up into his arms and
he presses a stubbly cheek
against mine.
“What did you do

tonight?” I ask.
“Some
guys
were
playing poker after work,
so I hung around for a bit.
Hope that was okay.”
“Of course,” I say.
“More fun than my night.”
“Who all showed up?”
“Oh, Campbell and
Insley and their dancing
monkeys. Boring. You
dodged a bullet. A really
lame bullet.”

He squeezes me into
him—those strong arms—
and hauls me up the stairs.
“God, I love you,” he says.
Then comes sex and a
stiff drink and a night of
sleep in a sweet, exhausted
ratsʼ tangle in our big, soft
bed. Poor me.

NICK DUNNE
ONE DAY GONE

I didnʼt listen to Go
about the booze. I finished
half the bottle sitting on
her sofa by myself, my
eighteenth
burst
of

adrenaline kicking in just
when I thought Iʼd finally
go to sleep: My eyes were
shutting, I was shifting my
pillow, my eyes were
closed, and then I saw my
wife, blood clotting her
blond hair, weeping and
blind in pain, scraping
herself along our kitchen
floor. Calling my name.
Nick, Nick, Nick!
I took repeated tugs on

the bottle, psyching myself
up for sleep, a losing
routine. Sleep is like a cat:
It only comes to you if you
ignore it. I drank more and
continued my mantra. Stop
thinking, swig, empty your
head, swig, now, seriously,
empty your head, do it now,
swig. You need to be sharp
tomorrow, you need to sleep!
Swig. I got nothing more
than a fussy nap toward

dawn, woke up an hour
later with a hangover. Not
a disabling hangover, but
decent. I was tender and
dull. Fuggy. Maybe still a
little drunk. I stutterwalked to Goʼs Subaru, the
movement feeling alien,
like my legs were on
backward. I had temporary
ownership of the car; the
police
had
graciously
accepted my gently used

Jetta for inspection along
with my laptop—all just a
formality, I was assured. I
drove home to get myself
some decent clothes.
Three police cruisers
sat on my block, our very
few neighbors milling
around. No Carl, but there
was
Jan
Teverer—the
Christian lady—and Mike,
the father of the threeyear-old IVF triplets—

Trinity,
Topher,
and
Talullah. (“I hate them all,
just by name,” said Amy, a
grave judge of anything
trendy. When I mentioned
that the name Amy was
once trendy, my wife said,
“Nick, you know the story
of my name.” I had no idea
what she was talking
about.)
Jan nodded from a
distance without meeting

my eyes, but Mike strode
over to me as I got out of
my car. “Iʼm so sorry, man,
anything I can do, you let
me know. Anything. I did
the mowing this morning,
so at least you donʼt
needta worry about that.”
Mike and I took turns
mowing all the abandoned
foreclosed properties in
the complex—heavy rains
in the spring had turned

yards into jungles, which
encouraged an influx of
raccoons. We had raccoons
everywhere,
gnawing
through our garbage late
at night, sneaking into our
basements, lounging on
our porches like lazy house
pets. The mowing didnʼt
seem to make them go
away, but we could at
least see them coming
now.

“Thanks, man, thank
you,” I said.
“Man, my wife, sheʼs
been hysterical since she
heard,”
he
said.
“Absolutely hysterical.”
“Iʼm so sorry to hear
that,” I said. “I gotta—” I
pointed at my door.
“Just sitting around,
crying over pictures of
Amy.”
I had no doubt that a

thousand Internet photos
had popped up overnight,
just to feed the pathetic
needs of women like
Mikeʼs wife. I had no
sympathy
for
drama
queens.
“Hey, I gotta ask—”
Mike started.
I patted his arm and
pointed again at the door,
as if I had pressing
business. I turned away

before he could ask any
questions and knocked on
the door of my own house.
Officer
Velásquez
escorted me upstairs, into
my own bedroom, into my
own
closet—past
the
silvery perfect-square gift
box—and let me rifle
through my things. It
made me tense, selecting
clothes in front of this
young woman with the

long brown braid, this
woman who had to be
judging me, forming an
opinion. I ended up
grabbing blindly: The final
look was business-casual,
slacks and short sleeves,
like I was going to a
convention. It would make
an interesting essay, I
thought,
picking
out
appropriate clothes when a
loved one goes missing.

The greedy, angle-hungry
writer in me, impossible to
turn off.
I jammed it all into a
bag and turned back
around, looking at the gift
box on the floor. “Could I
look inside?” I asked her.
She hesitated, then
played it safe. “No, Iʼm
sorry, sir. Better not right
now.”
The edge of the gift

wrapping
had
been
carefully
slit.
“Has
somebody looked inside?”
She nodded.
I
stepped
around
Velásquez toward the box.
“If itʼs already been looked
at then—”
She stepped in front of
me. “Sir, I canʼt let you do
that.”
“This is ridiculous. Itʼs
for me from my wife—”

I stepped back around
her, bent down, and had
one hand on the corner of
the box when she slapped
an arm across my chest
from behind. I felt a
momentary spurt of fury,
that this woman presumed
to tell me what to do in my
own home. No matter how
hard I try to be my
motherʼs son, my dadʼs
voice comes into my head

unbidden,
depositing
awful
thoughts,
nasty
words.
“Sir, this is a crime
scene, you—”
Stupid bitch.
Suddenly her partner,
Riordan, was in the room
and on me too, and I was
shaking them off—fine,
fine, fuck—and they were
forcing me down the
stairs. A woman was on all

fours near the front door,
squirreling
along
the
floorboards, searching, I
assume, for blood spatter.
She looked up at me
impassively, then back
down.
I forced myself to
decompress as I drove
back to Goʼs to dress. This
was only one in a long
series of annoying and
asinine things the police

would do in the course of
this investigation (I like
rules that make sense, not
rules without logic), so I
needed to calm down: Do
not antagonize the cops, I
told myself. Repeat if
necessary:
Do
not
antagonize the cops.
I ran into Boney as I
entered the police station,
and she said, “Your in-laws
are here, Nick,” in an

encouraging tone, like she
was offering me a warm
muffin.
Marybeth and Rand
Elliott were standing with
their arms around each
other. Middle of the police
station, they looked like
they were posing for prom
photos. Thatʼs how I
always saw them, hands
patting, chins nuzzling,
cheeks rubbing. Whenever

I visited the Elliott home, I
became
an
obsessive
throat-clearer—Iʼm about
to
enter—because
the
Elliotts could be around
any corner, cherishing
each other. They kissed
each other full on the
mouth whenever they
were parting, and Rand
would cup his wifeʼs rear
as he passed her. It was
foreign to me. My parents

divorced when I was
twelve, and I think maybe,
when I was very young, I
witnessed a chaste cheek
kiss between the two when
it was impossible to avoid.
Christmas, birthdays. Dry
lips. On their best married
days,
their
communications
were
entirely
transactional:
Weʼre out of milk again. (Iʼll
get some today.) I need this

ironed properly. (Iʼll do that
today.) How hard is it to
buy milk? (Silence.) You
forgot to call the plumber.
(Sigh.) Goddammit, put on
your coat, right now, and go
out and get some goddamn
milk. Now. These messages
and orders brought to you
by my father, a midlevel
phone-company manager
who treated my mother at
best like an incompetent

employee. At worst? He
never beat her, but his
pure, inarticulate fury
would fill the house for
days, weeks, at a time,
making the air humid,
hard to breathe, my father
stalking around with his
lower jaw jutting out,
giving him the look of a
wounded, vengeful boxer,
grinding his teeth so loud
you could hear it across

the room. Throwing things
near her but not exactly at
her. Iʼm sure he told
himself: I never hit her. Iʼm
sure because of this
technicality he never saw
himself as an abuser. But
he turned our family life
into an endless road trip
with bad directions and a
rage-clenched driver, a
vacation that never got a
chance to be fun. Donʼt

make me turn this car
around. Please, really, turn
it around.
I donʼt think my
fatherʼs issue was with my
mother in particular. He
just didnʼt like women. He
thought they were stupid,
inconsequential, irritating.
That dumb bitch. It was his
favorite phrase for any
woman who annoyed him:
a fellow motorist, a

waitress, our grade school
teachers, none of whom he
ever actually met, parentteacher
conferences
stinking of the female
realm as they did. I still
remember when Geraldine
Ferraro was named the
1984 vice presidential
candidate, us all watching
it on the news before
dinner. My mother, my
tiny, sweet mom, put her

hand on the back of Goʼs
head and said, Well, I think
itʼs wonderful. And my dad
flipped the TV off and
said, Itʼs a joke. You know
itʼs a goddamn joke. Like
watching a monkey ride a
bike.
It took another five
years before my mother
finally decided she was
done. I came home from
school one day and my

father was gone. He was
there in the morning and
gone by the afternoon. My
mom sat us down at the
dining
table
and
announced, “Your father
and I have decided it
would be best for everyone
if we live apart,” and Go
burst into tears and said,
“Good, I hate you both!”
and then, instead of
running to her room like

the script called for, she
went to my mom and
hugged her.
So my father went
away and my thin, pained
mother got fat and happy
—fairly fat and extremely
happy—as if she were
supposed to be that way
all along: a deflated
balloon taking in air.
Within a year, sheʼd
morphed into the busy,

warm, cheerful lady sheʼd
be till she died, and her
sister said things like
“Thank God the old
Maureen is back,” as if the
woman who raised us was
an imposter.
As for my father, for
years I spoke to him on the
phone about once a
month, the conversations
polite and newsy, a recital
of things that happened. The

only question my father
ever asked about Amy was
“How is Amy?,” which was
not meant to elicit any
answer beyond “Sheʼs
fine.”
He
remained
stubbornly distant even as
he faded into dementia in
his sixties. If youʼre always
early, youʼre never late. My
dadʼs mantra, and that
included the onset of
Alzheimerʼs—a
slow

decline into a sudden,
steep drop that forced us
to move our independent,
misogynistic father to a
giant home that stank of
chicken broth and piss,
where heʼd be surrounded
by women helping him at
all times. Ha.
My dad had limitations.
Thatʼs what my goodhearted mom always told
us. He had limitations, but

he meant no harm. It was
kind of her to say, but he
did do harm. I doubt my
sister will ever marry: If
sheʼs sad or upset or
angry, she needs to be
alone—she fears a man
dismissing her womanly
tears. Iʼm just as bad. The
good stuff in me I got from
my mom. I can joke, I can
laugh, I can tease, I can
celebrate and support and

praise—I can operate in
sunlight, basically—but I
canʼt deal with angry or
tearful women. I feel my
fatherʼs rage rise up in me
in the ugliest way. Amy
could tell you about that.
She would definitely tell
you, if she were here.
I watched Rand and
Marybeth for a moment
before they saw me. I
wondered how furious

theyʼd be with me. I had
committed an unforgivable
act, not phoning them for
so long. Because of my
cowardice, my in-laws
would always have that
night of tennis lodged in
their imagination: the
warm evening, the lazy
yellow
balls
bumping
along the court, the squeak
of tennis shoes, the
average Thursday night

theyʼd spent while their
daughter was disappeared.
“Nick,” Rand Elliott
said, spotting me. He took
three big strides toward
me, and as I braced myself
for a punch, he hugged me
desperately hard.
“How are you holding
up?” he whispered into my
neck, and began rocking.
Finally, he gave a highpitched gulp, a swallowed

sob, and gripped me by the
arms. “Weʼre going to find
Amy, Nick. It canʼt go any
other way. Believe that,
okay?” Rand Elliott held
me in his blue stare for a
few more seconds, then
broke up again—three
girlish gasps burst from
him like hiccups—and
Marybeth moved into the
huddle, buried her face in
her husbandʼs armpit.

When we parted, she
looked up at me with giant
stunned eyes. “Itʼs just a—
just a goddamn nightmare,”
she said. “How are you,
Nick?”
When Marybeth asked
How are you, it wasnʼt a
courtesy,
it
was
an
existential question. She
studied my face, and I was
sure she was studying me,
and would continue to

note my every thought and
action.
The
Elliotts
believed that every trait
should
be
considered,
judged, categorized. It all
means something, it can
all be used. Mom, Dad,
Baby, they were three
advanced people with
three advanced degrees in
psychology—they thought
more before nine A.M.
than most people thought

all month. I remember
once declining cherry pie
at dinner, and Rand
cocked his head and said,
“Ahh! Iconoclast. Disdains
the
easy,
symbolic
patriotism.” And when I
tried to laugh it off and
said, well, I didnʼt like
cherry
cobbler
either,
Marybeth touched Randʼs
arm: “Because of the
divorce. All those comfort

foods, the desserts a family
eats together, those are
just bad memories for
Nick.”
It
was
silly
but
incredibly sweet, these
people spending so much
energy trying to figure me
out. The answer: I donʼt
like cherries.
By eleven-thirty, the
station was a rolling boil
of noise. Phones were

ringing,
people
were
yelling across the room. A
woman whose name I
never caught, whom I
registered only as a
chattering bobblehead of
hair, suddenly made her
presence known at my
side. I had no idea how
long sheʼd been there:
“… and the main point of
this, Nick, is just to get
people looking for Amy

and knowing she has a
family who loves her and
wants her back. This will
be very controlled. Nick,
you will need to— Nick?”
“Yep.”
“People will want to
hear a quick statement
from her husband.”
From across the room,
Go was darting toward me.
Sheʼd dropped me at the
station, then run by The

Bar to take care of bar
things for thirty minutes,
and now she was back,
acting
like
sheʼd
abandoned me for a week,
zigzagging between desks,
ignoring the young officer
whoʼd
clearly
been
assigned to usher her in,
neatly, in a hushed,
dignified manner.
“Okay so far?” Go said,
squeezing me with one

arm, the dude hug. The
Dunne kids donʼt perform
hugs well. Goʼs thumb
landed on my right nipple.
“I wish Mom was here,”
she whispered, which was
what Iʼd been thinking.
“No news?” she asked
when she pulled away.
“Nothing,
fucking
nothing—”
“You look like you feel
awful.”

“I feel like fucking
shit.” I was about to say
what an idiot I was, not
listening to her about the
booze.
“I would have finished
the bottle too.” She patted
my back.
“Itʼs almost time,” the
PR woman said, again
appearing magically. “Itʼs
not a bad turnout for a
July Fourth weekend.” She

started herding us all
toward
a
dismal
conference
room—
aluminum
blinds
and
folding chairs and a clutch
of bored reporters—and up
onto the platform. I felt
like a third-tier speaker at
a mediocre convention, me
in
my
business-casual
blues, addressing a captive
audience of jet-lagged
people daydreaming about

what theyʼd eat for lunch.
But I could see the
journalists perk up when
they caught sight of me—
letʼs say it: a young,
decent-looking guy—and
then the PR woman placed
a cardboard poster on a
nearby easel, and it was a
blown-up photo of Amy at
her most stunning, that
face that made you keep
double-checking: She canʼt

be that good-looking, can
she? She could, she was,
and I stared at the photo of
my wife as the cameras
snapped photos of me
staring at the photo. I
thought of that day in New
York when I found her
again: the blond hair, the
back of her head, was all I
could see, but I knew it
was her, and I saw it as a
sign. How many millions

of heads had I seen in my
life, but I knew this was
Amyʼs pretty skull floating
down Seventh Avenue in
front of me. I knew it was
her, and that we would be
together.
Cameras
flashed.
I
turned away and saw
spots. It was surreal.
Thatʼs what people always
say to describe moments
that are merely unusual. I

thought: You have no
fucking idea what surreal is.
My hangover was really
warming up now, my left
eye throbbing like a heart.
The
cameras
were
clicking, and the two
families stood together, all
of us with mouths in thin
slits, Go the only one
looking even close to a
real person. The rest of us
looked like placeholder

humans, bodies that had
been dollied in and
propped up. Amy, over on
her easel, looked more
present. Weʼd all seen
these news conferences
before—when
other
women went missing. We
were being forced to
perform the scene that TV
viewers
expected:
the
worried
but
hopeful
family.
Caffeine-dazed

eyes and ragdoll arms.
My name was being
said; the room gave a
collective
gulp
of
expectation. Showtime.
When
I
saw
the
broadcast later, I didnʼt
recognize my voice. I
barely recognized my face.
The
booze
floating,
sludgelike, just beneath
the surface of my skin
made me look like a fleshy

wastrel,
just
sensuous
enough to be disreputable.
I had worried about my
voice wavering, so I
overcorrected and the
words came out clipped,
like I was reading a stock
report. “We just want Amy
to get home safe …”
Utterly
unconvincing,
disconnected. I might as
well have been reading
numbers at random.

Rand Elliott stepped up
and tried to save me: “Our
daughter, Amy, is a
sweetheart of a girl, full of
life. Sheʼs our only child,
and sheʼs smart and
beautiful and kind. She
really is Amazing Amy.
And we want her back.
Nick wants her back.” He
put a hand on my
shoulder, wiped his eyes,
and I involuntarily turned

to steel. My father again:
Men donʼt cry.
Rand kept talking: “We
all want her back where
she belongs, with her
family. Weʼve set up a
command center over at
the Days Inn …”
The
news
reports
would show Nick Dunne,
husband of the missing
woman,
standing
metallically next to his

father-in-law,
arms
crossed,
eyes
glazed,
looking almost bored as
Amyʼs parents wept. And
then worse. My longtime
response, the need to
remind people I wasnʼt a
dick, I was a nice guy
despite the affectless stare,
the haughty, douchebag
face.
So there it came, out of
nowhere, as Rand begged

for his daughterʼs return: a
killer smile.

AMY
ELLIOTT
DUNNE
JULY 5, 2010

DIARY ENTRY

I wonʼt blame Nick. I
donʼt blame Nick. I refuse
—refuse!—to turn into

some
pert-mouthed,
strident angry-girl. I made
two promises to myself
when I married Nick. One:
no
dancing-monkey
demands. Two: I would
never, ever say, Sure, thatʼs
fine by me (if you want to
stay out later, if you want to
do a boysʼ weekend, if you
want to do something you
want to do) and then
punish him for doing what

I said was fine by me. I
worry I am coming
perilously
close
to
violating both of those
promises.
But still. It is our third
wedding anniversary and I
am
alone
in
our
apartment, my face all
mask-tight
from
tears
because, well, because:
Just this afternoon, I get a
voice mail from Nick, and

I already know itʼs going
to be bad, I know the
second the voice mail
begins because I can tell
heʼs calling from his cell
and I can hear menʼs
voices in the background
and a big, roomy gap, like
heʼs trying to decide what
to say, and then I hear his
taxi-blurred voice, a voice
that is already wet and
lazy with booze, and I

know I am going to be
angry—that quick inhale,
the lips going tight, the
shoulders up, the I so donʼt
want to be mad but Iʼm
going to be feeling. Do men
not know that feeling? You
donʼt want to be mad, but
youʼre obligated to be,
almost. Because a rule, a
good rule, a nice rule is
being broken. Or maybe
rule is the wrong word.

Protocol? Nicety? But the
rule/protocol/nicety—our
anniversary—is
being
broken for a good reason, I
understand, I do. The
rumors were true: Sixteen
writers have been laid off
at Nickʼs magazine. A third
of the staff. Nick has been
spared, for now, but of
course he feels obliged to
take the others out to get
drunk. They are men, piled

in a cab, heading down
Second
Avenue,
pretending to be brave. A
few have gone home to
their
wives,
but
a
surprising number have
stayed out. Nick will spend
the
night
of
our
anniversary buying these
men drinks, going to strip
clubs and cheesy bars,
flirting with twenty-twoyear-olds (My friend here

just got laid off, he could use
a hug). These jobless men
will proclaim Nick a great
guy as he buys their drinks
on a credit card linked to
my bank account. Nick
will have a grand old time
on our anniversary, which
he didnʼt even mention in
the message. Instead, he
said, I know we had plans
but …
I am being a girl. I just

thought itʼd be a tradition:
All across town, I have
strewn
little
love
messages, reminders of our
past year together, my
treasure hunt. I can picture
the third clue, fluttering
from a piece of Scotch tape
in the crook of the V of the
Robert
Indiana
Love
sculpture up near Central
Park. Tomorrow, some
bored
twelve-year-old

tourist stumbling along
behind his parents is going
to pick it off, read it,
shrug, and let it float away
like a gum wrapper.
My treasure-hunt finale
was perfect, but isnʼt now.
Itʼs an absolutely gorgeous
vintage briefcase. Leather.
Third
anniversary
is
leather. A work-related gift
may be a bad idea, given
that work isnʼt exactly

happy right now. In our
kitchen, I have two live
lobsters, like always. Or
like what was supposed to
be like always. I need to
phone my mom and see if
they can keep for a day,
scrambling dazedly around
their crate, or if I need to
stumble in, and with my
wine-lame eyes, battle
them and boil them in my
pot for no good reason.

Iʼm killing two lobsters I
wonʼt even eat.
Dad phoned to wish us
happy anniversary, and I
picked up the phone and I
was going to play it cool,
but then I started crying
when I started talking—I
was doing the awful chick
talk-cry:
mwaha-waahgwwahh-and-waaa-wa—so I
had to tell him what
happened, and he told me

I should open a bottle of
wine and wallow in it for a
bit. Dad is always a
proponent of a good
indulgent sulk. Still, Nick
will be angry that I told
Rand, and of course Rand
will do his fatherly thing,
pat Nick on the shoulder
and say, “Heard you had
some emergency drinking
to do on your anniversary,
Nicky.” And chuckle. So

Nick will know, and he
will be angry with me
because he wants my
parents to believe heʼs
perfect—he beams when I
tell them stories about
what a flawless son-in-law
he is.
Except for tonight. I
know, I know, Iʼm being a
girl.
Itʼs five A.M. The sun is

coming up, almost as
bright as the streetlights
outside that have just
blinked off. I always like
that switch, when Iʼm
awake for it. Sometimes,
when I canʼt sleep, Iʼll pull
myself out of bed and walk
through the streets at
dawn, and when the lights
click off, all together, I
always feel like Iʼve seen
something special. Oh,

there go the streetlights! I
want to announce. In New
York itʼs not three or four
A.M. thatʼs the quiet time
—there are too many bar
stragglers, calling out to
each other as they collapse
into taxis, yelping into
their cell phones as they
frantically smoke that one
last cigarette before bed.
Five A.M., thatʼs the best
time, when the clicking of

your heels on the sidewalk
sounds illicit. All the
people have been put
away in their boxes, and
you have the whole place
to yourself.
Hereʼs what happened:
Nick got home just after
four, a bulb of beer and
cigarettes and fried-egg
odor attached to him, a
placenta of stink. I was
still awake, waiting for

him, my brain ca-thunking
after a marathon of Law
and Order. He sat down on
our ottoman and glanced
at the present on the table
and said nothing. I stared
at him back. He clearly
wasnʼt going to even graze
against an apology—hey,
sorry things got screwy
today. Thatʼs all I wanted,
just
a
quick
acknowledgment.

“Happy
day
after
anniversary,” I start.
He sighs, a deep
aggrieved moan. “Amy,
Iʼve had the crappiest day
ever. Please donʼt lay a
guilt trip on me on top of
it.”
Nick grew up with a
father who never, ever
apologized, so when Nick
feels he has screwed up, he
goes on offense. I know

this, and I can usually wait
it out, usually.
“I was just saying
happy anniversary.”
“Happy
anniversary,
my asshole husband who
neglected me on my big
day.”
We sit silent for a
minute,
my
stomach
knotting. I donʼt want to
be the bad guy here. I
donʼt deserve that. Nick

stands up.
“Well, how was it?” I
ask dully.
“How was it? It was
fucking awful. Sixteen of
my friends now have no
jobs. It was miserable. Iʼll
probably be gone too,
another few months.”
Friends. He doesnʼt
even like half the guys he
was out with, but I say
nothing.

“I know it feels dire
right now, Nick. But—”
“Itʼs not dire for you,
Amy. Not for you, it never
will be dire. But for the
rest of us? Itʼs very
different.”
The same old. Nick
resents that Iʼve never had
to worry about money and
I never will. He thinks that
makes me softer than
everyone else, and I

wouldnʼt disagree with
him. But I do work. I clock
in and clock back out.
Some of my girlfriends
have literally never had a
job; they discuss people
with jobs in the pitying
tones you talk about a fat
girl with “such a nice
face.” They will lean
forward and say, “But of
course, Ellen has to work,”
like something out of a

Noël Coward play. They
donʼt count me, because I
can always quit my job if I
want to. I could build my
days
around
charity
committees and home
decoration and gardening
and volunteering, and I
donʼt
think
thereʼs
anything
wrong
with
building a life around
those
things.
Most
beautiful, good things are

done by women people
scorn. But I work.
“Nick, Iʼm on your side
here. Weʼll be okay no
matter what. My money is
your money.”
“Not according to the
prenup.”
He is drunk. He only
mentions the prenup when
heʼs drunk. Then all the
resentment comes back.
Iʼve told him hundreds,

literally hundreds of times,
Iʼve said the words: The
prenup is pure business.
Itʼs not for me, itʼs not
even for my parents, itʼs
for my parentsʼ lawyers. It
says nothing about us, not
you and me.
He walks over toward
the kitchen, tosses his
wallet and wilted dollars
on the coffee table,
crumples a piece of

notepaper and tosses it in
the trash with a series of
credit-card receipts.
“Thatʼs a shitty thing to
say, Nick.”
“Itʼs a shitty way to
feel, Amy.”
He walks to our bar—
in the careful, swampwading gait of a drunk—
and actually pours himself
another drink.
“Youʼre going to make

yourself sick,” I say.
He raises his glass in an
up-yours cheers to me.
“You just donʼt get it,
Amy. You just canʼt. Iʼve
worked
since
I
was
fourteen years old. I didnʼt
get to go to fucking tennis
camp and creative-writing
camp and SAT prep and all
that shit that apparently
everyone else in New York
City did, because I was

wiping down tables at the
mall and I was mowing
lawns and I was driving to
Hannibal
and
fucking
dressing like Huck Finn for
the tourists and I was
cleaning the funnel-cake
skillets at midnight.”
I feel an urge to laugh,
actually to guffaw. A big
belly laugh that would
sweep up Nick, and soon
weʼd both be laughing and

this would be over. This
litany of crummy jobs.
Being married to Nick
always reminds me: People
have to do awful things for
money. Ever since Iʼve
been married to Nick, I
always wave to people
dressed as food.
“Iʼve had to work so
much harder than anyone
else at the magazine to
even get to the magazine.

Twenty years, basically,
Iʼve been working to get
where I am, and now itʼs
all going to be gone, and
thereʼs not a fucking thing
I know how to do instead,
unless I want to go back
home, be a river rat
again.”
“Youʼre probably too
old to play Huck Finn,” I
say.
“Fuck you, Amy.”

And then he goes to the
bedroom. Heʼs never said
that to me before, but it
came out of his mouth so
smoothly that I assume—
and this never crossed my
mind—I
assume
heʼs
thought it. Many times. I
never thought Iʼd be the
kind of woman whoʼd be
told to fuck herself by her
husband. And weʼve sworn
never to go to bed angry.

Compromise,
communicate, and never
go to bed angry—the three
pieces of advice gifted and
regifted to all newlyweds.
But lately it seems I am the
only
one
who
compromises;
our
communications
donʼt
solve anything; and Nick is
very good at going to bed
angry. He can turn off his
emotions like a spout. He

is already snoring.
And then I canʼt help
myself, even though itʼs
none of my business, even
though Nick would be
furious if he knew: I cross
over to the trash can and
pull out the receipts, so I
can picture where heʼs
been all night. Two bars,
two strip clubs. And I can
see him in each one,
talking about me with his

friends, because he must
have already talked about
me for all that petty,
smeared meanness to come
out so easily. I picture
them at one of the pricier
strip clubs, the posh ones
that make men believe
they are still designed to
rule, that women are
meant to serve them, the
deliberately bad acoustics
and thwumping music so

no one has to talk, a
stretch-titted
woman
straddling my husband
(who swears itʼs all in
fun), her hair trailing
down her back, her lips
wet with gloss, but Iʼm not
supposed to be threatened,
no itʼs just boyish hijinks, I
am supposed to laugh
about it, I am supposed to
be a good sport.
Then I unroll the

crumpled
piece
of
notebook paper and see a
girlʼs
handwriting—
Hannah—and a phone
number. I wish it were like
the movies, the name
something silly, CanDee or
Bambie, something you
could roll your eyes at.
Misti with two hearts over
the Iʼs. But itʼs Hannah,
which is a real woman,
presumably like me. Nick

has never cheated on me,
he has sworn it, but I also
know he has ample
opportunity. I could ask
him about Hannah, and
heʼd say, I have no idea
why she gave me her
number, but I didnʼt want to
be rude, so I took it. Which
may be true. Or not. He
could cheat on me and he
would never tell me, and
he would think less and

less of me for not figuring
it out. He would see me
across the breakfast table,
innocently slurping cereal,
and know that I am a fool,
and how can anyone
respect a fool?
Now I am crying again,
with Hannah in my hand.
Itʼs a very female thing,
isnʼt it, to take one boysʼ
night and snowball it into
a marital infidelity that

will destroy our marriage?
I donʼt know what I am
supposed to do. Iʼm feeling
like a shrill fishwife, or a
foolish doormat—I donʼt
know which. I donʼt want
to be angry, I canʼt even
figure out if I should be
angry. I consider checking
in to a hotel, let him
wonder about me for a
change.
I stay where I am for a

few minutes, and then I
take a breath and wade
into
our
booze-humid
bedroom, and when I get
in bed, he turns to me and
wraps his arms around me
and buries his face in my
neck, and at the same time
we both say, “Iʼm sorry.”

NICK DUNNE
ONE DAY GONE

Flashbulbs
exploded,
and I dropped the smile,
but not soon enough. I felt
a wave of heat roll up my
neck, and beads of sweat

broke out on my nose.
Stupid, Nick, stupid. And
then, just as I was pulling
myself together, the press
conference was over, and
it was too late to make any
other impression.
I walked out with the
Elliotts, my head ducked
low as more flashbulbs
popped. I was almost to
the exit when Gilpin
trotted across the room

toward me, flagging me
down: “Canna grab a
minute, Nick?”
He updated me as we
headed toward a back
office: “We checked out
that
house
in
your
neighborhood that was
broken into, looks like
people camped out there,
so weʼve got lab there.
And we found another
house on the edge of your

complex,
had
some
squatters.”
“I mean, thatʼs what
worries me,” I said. “Guys
are
camped
out
everywhere. This whole
town is overrun with
pissed-off,
unemployed
people.”
Carthage was, until a
year ago, a company town
and that company was the
sprawling Riverway Mall,

a tiny city unto itself that
once
employed
four
thousand locals—one-fifth
the population. It was built
in 1985, a destination mall
meant to attract shoppers
from all over the Middle
West. I still remember the
opening day: me and Go,
Mom and Dad, watching
the festivities from the
very back of the crowd in
the vast tarred parking lot,

because our father always
wanted to be able to leave
quickly, from anywhere.
Even at baseball games,
we parked by the exit and
left at the eighth inning,
me and Go a predictable
set of mustard-smeared
whines, petulant and sunfevered: We never get to see
the end. But this time our
faraway
vantage
was
desirable, because we got

to take in the full scope of
the Event: the impatient
crowd, leaning collectively
from one foot to another;
the mayor atop a redwhite-and-blue dais; the
booming
words—pride,
growth, prosperity, success—
rolling over us, soldiers on
the
battlefield
of
consumerism, armed with
vinyl-covered checkbooks
and quilted handbags. And

the doors opening. And the
rush
into
the
airconditioning, the Muzak,
the smiling salespeople
who were our neighbors.
My father actually let us
go inside that day, actually
waited in line and bought
us something that day:
sweaty
paper
cups
brimming with Orange
Julius.
For a quarter century,

the Riverway Mall was a
given. Then the recession
hit, washed away the
Riverway store by store
until the whole mall
finally went bust. It is now
two million square feet of
echo. No company came to
claim it, no businessman
promised a resurrection,
no one knew what to do
with it or what would
become of all the people

whoʼd
worked
there,
including my mother, who
lost her job at Shoe-BeDoo-Be—two decades of
kneeling and kneading, of
sorting
boxes
and
collecting
moist
foot
hosiery, gone without
ceremony.
The downfall of the
mall basically bankrupted
Carthage. People lost their
jobs, they lost their houses.

No one could see anything
good
coming
anytime
soon. We never get to see
the end. Except it looked
like this time Go and I
would. We all would.
The
bankruptcy
matched
my
psyche
perfectly.
For
several
years, I had been bored.
Not a whining, restless
childʼs boredom (although
I was not above that) but a

dense, blanketing malaise.
It seemed to me that there
was nothing new to be
discovered ever again. Our
society
was
utterly,
ruinously
derivative
(although
the
word
derivative as a criticism is
itself derivative). We were
the first human beings
who would never see
anything for the first time.
We stare at the wonders of

the
world,
dull-eyed,
underwhelmed. Mona Lisa,
the Pyramids, the Empire
State Building. Jungle
animals on attack, ancient
icebergs
collapsing,
volcanoes erupting. I canʼt
recall a single amazing
thing I have seen firsthand
that I didnʼt immediately
reference to a movie or TV
show.
A
fucking
commercial. You know the

awful singsong of the
blasé: Seeeen it. Iʼve
literally seen it all, and the
worst thing, the thing that
makes me want to blow
my brains out, is: The
secondhand experience is
always better. The image
is crisper, the view is
keener, the camera angle
and
the
soundtrack
manipulate my emotions
in a way reality canʼt

anymore. I donʼt know
that we are actually
human at this point, those
of us who are like most of
us, who grew up with TV
and movies and now the
Internet.
If
we
are
betrayed, we know the
words to say; when a loved
one dies, we know the
words to say. If we want to
play the stud or the smartass or the fool, we know

the words to say. We are
all working from the same
dog-eared script.
Itʼs a very difficult era
in which to be a person,
just a real, actual person,
instead of a collection of
personality traits selected
from an endless Automat
of characters.
And if all of us are
play-acting, there can be
no such thing as a soul

mate, because we donʼt
have genuine souls.
It had gotten to the
point where it seemed like
nothing matters, because
Iʼm not a real person and
neither is anyone else.
I would have done
anything to feel real again.
Gilpin opened the door
to the same room where
theyʼd questioned me the
night before. In the center

of the table sat Amyʼs
silvery gift box.
I stood staring at the
box sitting in the middle of
the table, so ominous in
this new setting. A sense of
dread descended on me.
Why hadnʼt I found it
before? I should have
found it.
“Go ahead,” Gilpin
said. “We wanted you to
take a look at this.”

I opened it as gingerly
as if a head might be
inside. I found only a
creamy blue envelope
marked FIRST CLUE.
Gilpin
smirked.
“Imagine our confusion: A
missing persons case, and
here we find an envelope
marked FIRST CLUE.”
“Itʼs for a treasure hunt
that my wife—”
“Right.
For
your

anniversary. Your fatherin-law mentioned it.”
I opened the envelope,
pulled out a thick sky-blue
piece of paper—Amyʼs
signature
stationery—
folded once. Bile crept up
my throat. These treasure
hunts
had
always
amounted to a single
question: Who is Amy?
(What is my wife thinking?
What was important to her

this past year? What
moments
made
her
happiest? Amy, Amy, Amy,
letʼs think about Amy.)
I read the first clue
with clenched teeth. Given
our marital mood the past
year, it was going to make
me look awful. I didnʼt
need anything else that
made me look awful.
I picture myself
as your student,

With a teacher so
handsome and wise
My mind opens
up (not to mention my
thighs!)
If I were your
pupil, thereʼd be no
need for flowers
Maybe just a
naughty
appointment
during your office hours
So hurry up, get
going, please do

And this time Iʼll
teach you a thing or
two.
It was an itinerary for
an alternate life. If things
had gone according to my
wifeʼs vision, yesterday
she would have hovered
near me as I read this
poem,
watching
me
expectantly,
the
hope
emanating from her like a
fever: Please get this. Please

get me.
And she would finally
say, So? And I would say:
“Oh, I actually know
this! She must mean my
office. At the junior
college. Iʼm an adjunct
professor there. Huh. I
mean, it must be, right?” I
squinted and reread. “She
took it easy on me this
year.”
“You want me to drive

you over?” Gilpin asked.
“Nah, Iʼve got Goʼs
car.”
“Iʼll follow you then.”
“You
think
itʼs
important?”
“Well, it shows her
movements the day or two
before she went missing.
So itʼs not unimportant.”
He
looked
at
the
stationery. “Itʼs sweet, you
know? Like something out

of a movie: a treasure
hunt. My wife and I, we
give each other a card and
maybe get a bite to eat.
Sounds like you guys were
doing it right. Preserve the
romance.”
Then Gilpin looked at
his shoes, got bashful, and
jingled his keys to leave.
The college had rather
grandly presented me with
a coffin of an office, big

enough for a desk, two
chairs,
some
shelves.
Gilpin and I wended our
way through the summerschool
students,
a
combination of impossibly
young kids (bored yet
busy, their fingers clicking
out texts or dialing up
music) and earnest older
people I had to assume
were mall layoffs, trying to
retrain for a new career.

“What do you teach?”
Gilpin asked.
“Journalism, magazine
journalism.” A girl texting
and walking forgot the
nuances of the latter and
almost ran into me. She
stepped to the side without
glancing up. It made me
feel cranky, off my lawn!
old.
“I thought you didnʼt
do journalism anymore.”

“He who canʼt do …” I
smiled.
I unlocked my office,
stepped into the closesmelling, dust-moted air.
Iʼd taken the summer off;
it had been weeks since Iʼd
been here. On my desk sat
another envelope, marked
SECOND CLUE.
“Your key always on
your key chain?” Gilpin
asked.

“Yup.”
“So Amy could have
borrowed that to get in?”
I tore down the side of
the envelope.
“And we have a spare
at home.” Amy made
doubles of everything—I
tended to misplace keys,
credit cards, cell phones,
but I didnʼt want to tell
Gilpin this, get another
baby-of-the-family
jab.

“Why?”
“Oh, just wanted to
make sure she wouldnʼt
have had to go through, I
donʼt know, a janitor or
someone.”
“No Freddy Krueger
types here, that Iʼve
noticed.”
“Never
saw
those
movies,” Gilpin replied.
Inside the envelope
were two folded slips of

paper. One was marked
with a heart; the other was
labeled CLUE.
Two notes. Different.
My stomach clenched. God
knew what Amy was going
to say. I opened the note
with the heart. I wished I
hadnʼt let Gilpin come,
and then I caught the first
words.
My
Darling
Husband,

I figured this
was the perfect
place—these
hallowed halls of
learning!—to
tell
you I think you are
a brilliant man. I
donʼt
tell
you
enough, but I am
amazed by your
mind: the weird
statistics
and
anecdotes,
the

strange facts, the
disturbing ability to
quote from any
movie, the quick
wit, the beautiful
way you have of
wording
things.
After years together,
I think a couple can
forget
how
wonderful they find
each
other.
I
remember when we

first
met,
how
dazzled I was by
you, and so I want
to take a moment to
tell you I still am
and itʼs one of my
favorite
things
about you: You are
BRILLIANT.
My mouth watered.
Gilpin was reading over
my shoulder, and he
actually sighed. “Sweet

lady,” he said. Then he
cleared his throat. “Um,
hah, these yours?”
He used the eraser end
of a pencil to pick up a
pair
of
womenʼs
underwear
(technically,
they
were
panties—
stringy, lacy, red—but I
know women get creeped
out by that word—just
Google hate the word
panties).
Theyʼd
been

hanging off a knob on the
AC unit.
“Oh,
jeez.
Thatʼs
embarrassing.”
Gilpin waited for an
explanation.
“Uh, one time Amy and
I, well, you read her note.
We kinda, you know, you
sometimes gotta spice
things up a little.”
Gilpin grinned. “Oh I
get it, randy professor and

naughty student. I get it.
You two really were doing
it right.” I reached for the
underwear, but Gilpin was
already
producing
an
evidence bag from his
pocket and sliding them in.
“Just a precaution,” he
said inexplicably.
“Oh, please donʼt,” I
said. “Amy would die—” I
caught myself.
“Donʼt worry, Nick, itʼs

all protocol, my friend.
You wouldnʼt believe the
hoops we gotta jump
through. Just in case, just in
case. Ridiculous. Whatʼs
the clue say?”
I let him read over my
shoulder
again,
his
jarringly
fresh
smell
distracting me.
“So whatʼs that one
mean?” he asked.
“I have no idea,” I lied.

I finally rid myself of
Gilpin,
then
drove
aimlessly
down
the
highway so I could make a
call on my disposable. No
pickup. I didnʼt leave a
message. I sped for a while
longer, as if I could get
anywhere, then I turned
around and drove the
forty-five minutes back
toward town to meet the
Elliotts at the Days Inn. I

walked into a lobby
packed with members of
the
Midwest
Payroll
Vendors
Association—
wheelie
bags
parked
everywhere, their owners
slurping
complimentary
drinks in small plastic cups
and networking, forced
guttural
laughs
and
pockets fished for business
cards. I rode up the
elevator with four men, all

balding and khakiʼd and
golf-shirted,
lanyards
bouncing
off
round
married bellies.
Marybeth opened the
door while talking on her
cell phone; she pointed
toward
the
TV
and
whispered to me, “We
have a cold-cut tray if you
want, sweetheart,” then
went into the bathroom
and closed the door, her

murmurs continuing.
She emerged a few
minutes later, just in time
for the local five oʼclock
news from St. Louis, which
led
with
Amyʼs
disappearance.
“Perfect
photo,”
Marybeth
murmured at the screen,
where Amy peered back at
us. “People will see it and
really know what Amy
looks like.”

Iʼd thought the portrait
—a head shot from Amyʼs
brief fling with acting—
beautiful but unsettling.
Amyʼs pictures gave a
sense of her actually
watching you, like an oldtime
haunted-house
portrait, the eyes moving
from left to right.
“We should get them
some candid photos too,” I
said.
“Some
everyday

ones.”
The Elliotts nodded in
tandem but said nothing,
watching. When the spot
was done, Rand broke the
silence: “I feel sick.”
“I know,” Marybeth
said.
“How are you holding
up, Nick?” Rand asked,
hunched over, hands on
both knees, as if he were
preparing to get up from

the sofa but couldnʼt quite
do it.
“Iʼm a goddamn mess,
to tell the truth. I feel so
useless.”
“You know, I gotta ask,
what
about
your
employees, Nick?” Rand
finally stood. He went to
the
minibar,
poured
himself a ginger ale, then
turned
to
me
and
Marybeth.
“Anyone?

Something? Anything?” I
shook my head; Marybeth
asked for a club soda.
“Want some gin with it
too, babe?” Rand asked,
his deep voice going high
on the final word.
“Sure. Yes. I do.”
Marybeth closed her eyes,
bent in half, and brought
her face between her
knees; then she took a
deep breath and sat back

up in her exact previous
position, as if it were all a
yoga exercise.
“I gave them lists of
everyone,” I said. “But itʼs
a pretty tame business,
Rand. I just donʼt think
thatʼs the place to look.”
Rand put a hand across
his mouth and rubbed
upward, the flesh of his
cheeks
bunching
up
around his eyes. “Of

course, weʼre doing the
same with our business,
Nick.”
Rand and Marybeth
always referred to the
Amazing Amy series as a
business, which on the
surface never failed to
strike me as silly: They are
childrenʼs books, about a
perfect little girl whoʼs
pictured on every book
cover, a cartoonish version

of my own Amy. But of
course they are (were) a
business, big business.
They were elementaryschool staples for the
better part of two decades,
largely because of the
quizzes at the end of every
chapter.
In third grade, for
instance, Amazing Amy
caught her friend Brian
overfeeding
the
class

turtle. She tried to reason
with him, but when Brian
persisted in the extra
helpings, Amy had no
choice but to narc on him
to her teacher: “Mrs.
Tibbles, I donʼt want to be
a tattletale, but Iʼm not
sure what to do. Iʼve tried
talking to Brian myself,
but now … I guess I might
need help from a grownup …” The fallout:

1) Brian
told Amy she was
an untrustworthy
friend and stopped
talking to her.
2) Her timid
pal Suzy said Amy
shouldnʼt
have
told; she should
have secretly fished
out
the
food
without
Brian
knowing.

3) Amyʼs
archrival, Joanna,
said Amy was
jealous and just
wanted to feed the
turtle herself.
4) Amy
refused to back
down—she felt she
did the proper
thing.
Who is right?!
Well,
thatʼs
easy,

because Amy is always
right, in every story.
(Donʼt think I havenʼt
brought this up in my
arguments with my real
Amy, because I have, more
than once.)
The quizzes—written
by two psychologists, who
are also parents like you!—
were supposed to tease out
a childʼs personality traits:
Is your wee one a sulker

who canʼt stand to be
corrected, like Brian? A
spineless enabler, like
Suzy? A pot-stirrer, like
Joanna? Or perfect, like
Amy? The books became
extremely trendy among
the rising yuppie class:
They were the Pet Rock of
parenting. The Rubikʼs
Cube of child rearing. The
Elliotts got rich. At one
point it was estimated that

every school library in
America had an Amazing
Amy book.
“Do you have worries
that this might link back to
the
Amazing
Amy
business?” I asked.
“We do have a few
people we thought might
be worth checking out,”
Rand began.
I coughed out a laugh.
“Do you think Judith

Viorst kidnapped Amy for
Alexander so he wouldnʼt
have any more Terrible,
Horrible, No Good, Very
Bad Days?”
Rand and Marybeth
turned matching surpriseddisappointed faces toward
me. It was a gross,
tasteless thing to say—my
brain had been burping up
such
inappropriate
thoughts at inopportune

moments. Mental gas I
couldnʼt control. Like, Iʼd
started internally singing
the
lyrics
to
“Bony
Moronie” whenever I saw
my cop friend. Sheʼs as
skinny as a stick of
macaroni, my brain would
bebop as Detective Rhonda
Boney was telling me
about dragging the river
for my missing wife.
Defense mechanism, I told

myself, just a weird defense
mechanism. Iʼd like it to
stop.
I rearranged my leg
delicately,
spoke
delicately, as if my words
were an unwieldy stack of
fine china. “Iʼm sorry, I
donʼt know why I said
that.”
“Weʼre all tired,” Rand
offered.
“Weʼll have the cops

round
up
Viorst,”
Marybeth tried. “And that
bitch Beverly Cleary too.”
It was less a joke than a
pardon.
“I guess I should tell
you,” I said. “The cops, itʼs
normal in this kind of case
—”
“To
look
at
the
husband first, I know,”
Rand interrupted. “I told
them theyʼre wasting their

time. The questions they
asked us—”
“They were offensive,”
Marybeth finished.
“So they have spoken
with you? About me?” I
moved
over
to
the
minibar, casually poured a
gin. I swallowed three
belts in a row and felt
immediately worse. My
stomach was working its
way up my esophagus.

“What kind of stuff did
they ask?”
“Have you ever hurt
Amy, has Amy ever
mentioned you threatening
her?” Marybeth ticked off.
“Are you a womanizer, has
Amy ever mentioned you
cheating on her? Because
that sounds like Amy,
right? I told them we
didnʼt raise a doormat.”
Rand put a hand on my

shoulder. “Nick, what we
should have said, first of
all, is: We know you would
never, ever hurt Amy. I
even told the police, told
them the story about you
saving the mouse at the
beach house, saving it
from the glue trap.” He
looked over at Marybeth
as if she didnʼt know the
story,
and
Marybeth
obliged with her rapt

attention. “Spent an hour
trying to corner the damn
thing, and then literally
drove the little rat bastard
out of town. Does that
sound like a guy who
would hurt his wife?”
I felt a burst of intense
guilt,
self-loathing.
I
thought for a second I
might cry, finally.
“We love you, Nick,”
Rand said, giving me a

final squeeze.
“We
do,
Nick,”
Marybeth echoed. “Youʼre
our son. We are so
incredibly sorry that on
top of Amy being gone,
you have to deal with this
—cloud of suspicion.”
I didnʼt like the phrase
cloud of suspicion. I much
preferred
routine
investigation or a mere
formality.

“They
did
wonder
about
your
restaurant
reservations that night,”
Marybeth said, an overly
casual glance.
“My reservations?”
“They said you told
them you had reservations
at Houstonʼs, but they
checked it out, and there
were no reservations. They
seemed really interested in
that.”

I had no reservation,
and I had no gift. Because
if I planned on killing Amy
that day, I wouldnʼt have
needed reservations for
that night or a gift Iʼd
never need to give her.
The hallmarks of an
extremely pragmatic killer.
I am pragmatic to a
fault—my friends could
certainly tell the police
that.

“Uh, no. No, I never
made reservations. They
must have misunderstood
me. Iʼll let them know.”
I collapsed on the
couch
across
from
Marybeth. I didnʼt want
Rand to touch me again.
“Oh,
okay.
Good,”
Marybeth said. “Did she,
uh, did you get a treasure
hunt this year?” Her eyes
turned
red
again.

“Before …”
“Yeah, they gave me
the first clue today. Gilpin
and I found the second one
in my office at the college.
Iʼm still trying to figure it
out.”
“Can we take a look?”
my mother-in-law asked.
“I donʼt have it with
me,” I lied.
“Will you … will you
try to solve it, Nick?”

Marybeth asked.
“I will, Marybeth. Iʼll
solve it.”
“I just hate the idea of
things she touched, left out
there, all alone—”
My phone rang, the
disposable, and I flicked a
glance at the display, then
shut it off. I needed to get
rid of the thing, but I
couldnʼt yet.
“You should pick up

every
call,
Nick,”
Marybeth said.
“I recognized this one
—just my college alum
fund looking for money.”
Rand sat beside me on
the couch. The ancient,
much abused cushions
sank severely under our
weight, so we ended up
pushed toward each other,
arms touching, which was
fine with Rand. He was

one of those guys whoʼd
pronounce Iʼm a hugger as
he came at you, neglecting
to ask if the feeling was
mutual.
Marybeth returned to
business: “We do think itʼs
possible an Amy obsessive
took her.” She turned to
me, as if pleading a case.
“Weʼve had ʼem over the
years.”
Amy had been fond of

recollecting stories of men
obsessed with her. She
described the stalkers in
hushed tones over glasses
of wine at various periods
during our marriage—men
who were still out there,
always thinking about her
and
wanting
her.
I
suspected these stories
were inflated: The men
always
came
off
as
dangerous to a very

precise
degree—enough
for me to worry about but
not enough to require us to
involve the police. In
short, a play world where I
could be Amyʼs chestpuffed hero, defending her
honor. Amy was too
independent, too modern,
to be able to admit the
truth: She wanted to play
damsel.
“Lately?”

“Not
lately,
no,”
Marybeth said, chewing
her lip. “But there was a
very disturbed girl back in
high school.”
“Disturbed how?”
“She was obsessed with
Amy. Well, with Amazing
Amy. Her name was Hilary
Handy—she
modeled
herself after Amyʼs best
friend in the books, Suzy.
At first it was cute, I guess.

And then it was like that
wasnʼt
good
enough
anymore—she wanted to
be Amazing Amy, not Suzy
the sidekick. So she began
imitating our Amy. She
dressed like Amy, she
colored her hair blond,
sheʼd linger outside our
house in New York. One
time I was walking down
the street and she came
running up to me, this

strange girl, and she
looped her arm through
mine and said, ʻIʼm going
to be your daughter now.
Iʼm going to kill Amy and
be your new Amy. Because
it doesnʼt really matter to
you, does it? As long as
you have an Amy.ʼ Like
our daughter was a piece
of fiction she could
rewrite.”
“We finally got a

restraining order because
she threw Amy down a
flight of stairs at school,”
Rand said. “Very disturbed
girl. That kind of mentality
doesnʼt go away.”
“And
then
Desi,”
Marybeth said.
“And Desi,” Rand said.
Even I knew about
Desi. Amy had attended a
Massachusetts
boarding
school called Wickshire

Academy—I had seen the
photos, Amy in lacrosse
skirts
and
headbands,
always with autumn colors
in the background, as if
the school were based not
in a town but in a month.
October. Desi Collings
attended
the
boysʼ
boarding school that was
paired with Wickshire. In
Amyʼs stories, he was a
pale, Romantic figure, and

their courtship had been of
the
boarding-school
variety: chilly football
games and overheated
dances, lilac corsages and
rides in a vintage Jaguar.
Everything a little bit
midcentury.
Amy dated Desi, quite
seriously, for a year. But
she began to find him
alarming: He talked as if
they were engaged, he

knew the number and
gender of their children.
They were going to have
four kids, all boys. Which
sounded suspiciously like
Desiʼs own family, and
when he brought his
mother down to meet her,
Amy grew queasy at the
striking
resemblance
between herself and Mrs.
Collings. The older woman
had kissed her cheek

coldly
and
murmured
calmly in her ear, “Good
luck.” Amy couldnʼt tell if
it was a warning or a
threat.
After Amy cut it off
with Desi, he still lingered
around
the
Wickshire
campus, a ghostly figure in
dark
blazers,
leaning
against wintry, leafless oak
trees. Amy returned from a
dance one February night

to find him lying on her
bed, naked, on top of the
covers, groggy from a very
marginal pill overdose.
Desi left school shortly
after.
But he still phoned her,
even now, and several
times a year sent her thick,
padded envelopes that
Amy tossed unopened after
showing them to me. They
were postmarked St. Louis.

Forty minutes away. “Itʼs
just a horrible, miserable
coincidence,” sheʼd told
me. Desi had the St. Louis
family connections on his
motherʼs side. This much
she knew but didnʼt care
to know more. Iʼd picked
through the trash to
retrieve one, read the
letter, sticky with alfredo
sauce, and it had been
utterly banal: talk of tennis

and travel and other things
preppy. Spaniels. I tried to
picture this slender dandy,
a fellow in bow ties and
tortoiseshell
glasses,
busting into our house and
grabbing Amy with soft,
manicured fingers. Tossing
her in the trunk of his
vintage
roadster
and
taking her … antiquing in
Vermont.
Desi.
Could
anyone believe it was

Desi?
“Desi lives not far
away, actually,” I said. “St.
Louis.”
“Now, see?” Rand said.
“Why are the cops not all
over this?”
“Someone needs to be,”
I said. “Iʼll go. After the
search here tomorrow.”
“The police definitely
seem to think itʼs … close
to home,” Marybeth said.

She kept her eyes on me
one beat too long, then
shivered, as if shaking off
a thought.

DIARY ENTRY

Summer.

Birdies.

Sunshine. I spent today
shuffling around Prospect
Park, my skin tender, my
bones
brittle.
Miserybattling.
It
is
an
improvement, since I spent
the previous three days in
our house in the same
crusty pajama set, marking
time until five, when I
could have a drink. Trying
to make myself remember
the suffering in Darfur. Put

things into perspective.
Which, I guess, is just
further
exploiting
the
people of Darfur.
So much has unraveled
the past week. I think
thatʼs what it is, that itʼs
all happened at once, so I
have the emotional bends.
Nick lost his job a month
ago. The recession is
supposed to be winding
down, but no one seems to

know that. So Nick lost his
job. Second round of
layoffs,
just
like
he
predicted—just
a
few
weeks after the first round.
Oops, we didnʼt fire nearly
enough people. Idiots.
At first I think Nick
might be okay. He makes a
massive list of things heʼs
always meant to do. Some
of itʼs tiny stuff: He
changes watch batteries

and resets clocks, he
replaces a pipe beneath
our sink and repaints all
the rooms we painted
before and didnʼt like.
Basically, he does a lot of
things over. Itʼs nice to
take some actual do-overs,
when you get so few in
life. And then he starts on
bigger stuff: He reads War
and Peace. He flirts with
taking Arabic lessons. He

spends a lot of time trying
to guess what skills will be
marketable over the next
few decades. It breaks my
heart, but I pretend it
doesnʼt for his sake.
I keep asking him: “Are
you sure youʼre okay?”
At first I try it
seriously, over coffee, eye
contact, my hand on his.
Then I try it breezily,
lightly, in passing. Then I

try it tenderly, in bed,
stroking his hair.
He has the same
answer always: “Iʼm fine. I
donʼt really want to talk
about it.”
I wrote a quiz that was
perfect for the times: “How
Are You Handling Your
Layoff?”
a) I sit in
my pajamas and
eat a lot of ice

cream—sulking is
therapeutic!
b) I write
nasty
things
about my old boss
online,
everywhere—
venting
feels
great!
c) Until a
new job comes
along, I try to
find useful things

to do with my
newfound time,
like learning a
marketable
language
or
finally
reading
War and Peace.
It was a compliment to
Nick—C was the correct
answer—but he just gave a
sour smile when I showed
it to him.
A few weeks in, the

bustling
stopped,
the
usefulness stopped, as if he
woke up one morning
under a decrepit, dusty
sign that read, Why
Fucking Bother? He went
dull-eyed. Now he watches
TV, surfs porn, watches
porn on TV. He eats a lot
of delivery food, the
Styrofoam shells propped
up near the overflowing
trash can. He doesnʼt talk

to me, he behaves as if the
act of talking physically
pains him and I am a
vicious woman to ask it of
him.
He barely shrugs when
I tell him I was laid off.
Last week.
“Thatʼs
awful,
Iʼm
sorry,” he says. “At least
you have your money to
fall back on.”
“We have the money. I

liked my job, though.”
He starts singing “You
Canʼt Always Get What
You Want,” off-key, highpitched, with a little
stumbling dance, and I
realize he is drunk. It is
late afternoon, a beautiful
blue-blue day, and our
house is dank, thick with
the sweet smell of rotting
Chinese food, the curtains
all drawn over, and I begin

walking room to room to
air it out, pulling back the
drapes, scaring the dust
motes, and when I reach
the darkened den, I
stumble over a bag on the
floor, and then another
and another, like the
cartoon cat who walks into
a room full of mousetraps.
When I switch on the
lights, I see dozens of
shopping bags, and they

are from places laid-off
people donʼt go. They are
the high-end menʼs stores,
the places that hand-tailor
suits, where salespeople
carry ties individually,
draped over an arm, to
male shoppers nestled in
leather armchairs. I mean,
the shit is bespoke.
“What is all this, Nick?”
“For job interviews. If
anyone ever starts hiring

again.”
“You needed so much?”
“We do have the
money.” He smiles at me
grimly, his arms crossed.
“Do you at least want
to hang them up?” Several
of the plastic coverings
have been chewed apart
by Bleecker. A tiny mound
of cat vomit lays near one
three-thousand-dollar suit;
a tailored white shirt is

covered in orange fur
where the cat has napped.
“Not really, nope,” he
said. He grins at me.
I have never been a
nag. I have always been
rather proud of my unnagginess. So it pisses me
off, that Nick is forcing me
to nag. I am willing to live
with a certain amount of
sloppiness, of laziness, of
the lackadaisical life. I

realize that I am more
type-A than Nick, and I try
to be careful not to inflict
my neat-freaky, to-do-list
nature on him. Nick is not
the kind of guy who is
going to think to vacuum
or clean out the fridge. He
truly doesnʼt see that kind
of stuff. Fine. Really. But I
do like a certain standard
of living—I think itʼs fair
to
say
the
garbage

shouldnʼt
literally
overflow, and the plates
shouldnʼt sit in the sink for
a week with smears of
bean burrito dried on
them. Thatʼs just being a
good grown-up roommate.
And Nickʼs not doing
anything anymore, so I
have to nag, and it pisses
me off: You are turning me
into what I never have been
and never wanted to be, a

nag, because you are not
living up to your end of a
very basic compact. Donʼt
do that, itʼs not okay to do.
I know, I know, I know
that losing a job is
incredibly stressful, and
particularly for a man,
they say it can be like a
death in the family, and
especially for a man like
Nick, who has always
worked, so I take a giant

breath, roll my anger up
into a red rubber ball, and
mentally kick it out into
space. “Well, do you mind
if I hang these up? Just so
they stay nice for you?”
“Knock yourself out.”
His-and-her
layoffs,
isnʼt that sweet? I know
we are luckier than most: I
go online and check my
trust fund whenever I get
nervous. I never called it a

trust fund before Nick did;
itʼs actually not that grand.
I mean, itʼs nice, itʼs great
—$785,404 that I have in
savings thanks to my
parents. But itʼs not the
kind of money that allows
you to stop working
forever, especially not in
New York. My parentsʼ
whole point was to make
me feel secure enough so I
didnʼt need to make

choices based on money—
in schooling, in career—
but not so well-off that I
could be tempted to check
out. Nick makes fun, but I
think itʼs a great gesture
for parents to make. (And
appropriate,
considering
they
plagiarized
my
childhood for the books.)
But Iʼm still feeling sick
about the layoff, our
layoffs, when my dad calls

and asks if he and Mom
can stop by. They need to
talk
with
us.
This
afternoon, now, actually, if
itʼs okay. Of course itʼs
okay, I say, and in my
head, I think, Cancer
cancer cancer.
My parents appear at
the door, looking like
theyʼve put up an effort.
My father is thoroughly
pressed and tucked and

shined, impeccable except
for the grooves beneath his
eyes. My mother is in one
of her bright purple
dresses that she always
wore to speeches and
ceremonies, back when she
got those invitations. She
says the color demands
confidence of the wearer.
They look great, but
they seem ashamed. I
usher them to the sofa,

and we all sit silently for a
second.
“Kids, your mother and
I, we seem to have—” my
father finally starts, then
stops to cough. He places
his hands on his knees; his
big knuckles pale. “Well,
we seem to have gotten
ourselves into a hell of a
financial mess.”
I donʼt know what my
reaction is supposed to be:

shocked,
consoling,
disappointed? My parents
have never confessed any
troubles to me. I donʼt
think theyʼve had many
troubles.
“The fact of the matter
is,
weʼve
been
irresponsible,” Marybeth
continues. “Weʼve been
living the past decade like
we were making the same
kind of money we did for

the previous two decades,
and we werenʼt. We
havenʼt made half that,
but we were in denial. We
were … optimistic may be a
kind way to put it. We just
kept thinking the next Amy
book would do the trick.
But that hasnʼt happened.
And we kept making bad
decisions. We invested
foolishly.
We
spent
foolishly. And now.”

“Weʼre
basically
broke,” Rand says. “Our
house, as well as this
house, itʼs all underwater.”
Iʼd thought—assumed
—theyʼd bought this house
for us outright. I had no
idea they were making
payments on it. I feel a
sting of embarrassment
that I am as sheltered as
Nick says.
“Like I said, we made

some serious judgment
errors,” Marybeth says.
“We should write a book:
Amazing Amy and the
Adjustable Rate Mortgage.
We would flunk every
quiz.
Weʼd
be
the
cautionary tale. Amyʼs
friend, Wendy Want It
Now.”
“Harry Head in the
Sand,” Rand adds.
“So
what
happens

next?” I ask.
“That is entirely up to
you,” my dad says. My
mom
fishes
out
a
homemade pamphlet from
her purse and sets it on the
table in front of us—bars
and graphs and pie charts
created on their home
computer. It kills me to
picture
my
parents
squinting over the userʼs
manual, trying to make

their proposition look
pretty for me.
Marybeth starts the
pitch: “We wanted to ask if
we could borrow some
money from your trust
while we figure out what
to do with the rest of our
lives.”
My parents sit in front
of us like two eager
college kids hoping for
their first internship. My

fatherʼs knee jiggles until
my mother places a gentle
fingertip on it.
“Well, the trust fund is
your money, so of course
you can borrow from it,” I
say. I just want this to be
over; the hopeful look on
my parentsʼ faces, I canʼt
stand it. “How much do
you think you need, to pay
everything off and feel
comfortable for a while?”

My father looks at his
shoes. My mother takes a
deep breath. “Six hundred
and fifty thousand,” she
says.
“Oh.” It is all I can say.
It is almost everything we
have.
“Amy, maybe you and I
should discuss—” Nick
begins.
“No, no, we can do
this,” I say. “Iʼll just go

grab my checkbook.”
“Actually,”
Marybeth
says, “if you could wire it
to our account tomorrow,
that would be best.
Otherwise thereʼs a tenday waiting period.”
Thatʼs when I know
they are in serious trouble.

NICK DUNNE
TWO DAYS
GONE

I woke up on the
pullout couch in the
Elliottsʼ suite, exhausted.
Theyʼd insisted I stay over
—my home had not yet
been reopened to me—

insisted with the same
urgency they once applied
to snapping up the check
at dinner: hospitality as
ferocious force of nature.
You must let us do this for
you. So I did. I spent the
night listening to their
snores
through
the
bedroom door, one steady
and
deep—a
hearty
lumberjack of a snore—the
other
gaspy
and

arrhythmic, as if the
sleeper were dreaming of
drowning.
I could always turn
myself off like a light. Iʼm
going to sleep, Iʼd say, my
hands in prayer position
against my cheek, Zzzzzz,
the deep sleep of a
NyQuiled child—while my
insomniac wife fussed in
bed next to me. Last night,
though, I felt like Amy, my

brain still going, my body
on edge. I was, most of the
time, a man who was
literally comfortable in his
own skin. Amy and I
would sit on the couch to
watch TV, and Iʼd turn to
melted wax, my wife
twitching and shifting
constantly next to me. I
asked her once if she
might have restless leg
syndrome—an ad for the

disease was running, the
actorsʼ faces all furrowed
in distress as they shook
their calves and rubbed
their thighs—and Amy
said,
I
have
restless
everything syndrome.
I watched the ceiling of
the hotel room turn gray
then pink then yellow and
finally pulled myself up to
see the sun blaring right at
me, across the river, again,

a solar third degree. Then
the names popped in my
head—bing! Hilary Handy.
Such an adorable name to
be
accused
of
such
disturbing
acts.
Desi
Collings,
a
former
obsessive who lived an
hour away. I had claimed
them both as mine. It is a
do-it-yourself era: health
care, real estate, police
investigation. Go online

and fucking figure it out
for
yourself
because
everyoneʼs
overworked
and understaffed. I was a
journalist. I spent over ten
years interviewing people
for a living and getting
them to reveal themselves.
I was up to the task, and
Marybeth
and
Rand
believed so too. I was
thankful they let me know
I was still in their trust, the

husband under a wispy
cloud of suspicion. Or do I
fool myself to use the word
wispy?
The Days Inn had
donated an underused
ballroom to serve as the
Find
Amy
Dunne
headquarters.
It
was
unseemly—a
place
of
brown stains and canned
smells—but
just
after
dawn, Marybeth set about

pygmalioning
it,
vacuuming
and
saniwiping, arranging bulletin
boards and phone banks,
hanging a large head shot
of Amy on one wall. The
poster—with Amyʼs cool,
confident gaze, those eyes
that followed you—looked
like something from a
presidential campaign. In
fact, by the time Marybeth
was done, the whole room

buzzed with efficiency—
the urgent hopefulness of a
seriously
underdog
politician with a lot of true
believers refusing to give
up.
Just after ten A.M.,
Boney arrived, talking into
her cell phone. She patted
me on the shoulder and
began fiddling with a
printer. The volunteers
arrived in bunches: Go and

a half dozen of our late
motherʼs friends. Five
fortysomething women, all
in capri pants, like they
were rehearsing a dance
show: two of them—
slender and blond and
tanned—vying for the
lead, the others cheerfully
resigned to second string.
A group of loudmouthed
white-haired old ladies,
each trying to talk over the

next, a few of them
texting, the kind of elderly
people who have a baffling
amount of energy, so much
youthful vigor you had to
wonder if they were trying
to rub it in. Only one man
showed up, a good-looking
guy about my age, well
dressed, alone, failing to
realize that his presence
could use some explaining.
I watched Loner Guy as he

sniffed around the pastries,
sneaking glances at the
poster of Amy.
Boney finished setting
up the printer, grabbed a
branny-looking
muffin,
and came to stand by me.
“Do you guys keep an
eye on everyone who
reports to volunteer?” I
asked. “I mean, in case itʼs
someone—”
“Someone who seems

to have a suspicious
amount
of
interest?
Absolutely.” She broke off
the edges of the muffin
and popped them in her
mouth. She dropped her
voice. “But to tell the
truth, serial killers watch
the same TV shows we do.
They know that we know
they like to—”
“Insert themselves into
the investigation.”

“Thatʼs it, yup.” She
nodded. “So theyʼre more
careful about that kind of
thing now. But yeah, we
sift through all the kindaweirdos to make sure
theyʼre just, you know,
kinda-weirdos.”
I raised an eyebrow.
“Like, Gilpin and I were
lead detectives on the
Kayla Holman case few
years
back.
Kayla

Holman?”
I shook my head: no
bell.
“Anyway, youʼll find
some ghouls get attracted
to stuff like this. And
watch out for those two—”
Boney pointed toward the
two pretty fortysomething
women. “Because they
look like the type. To get a
little too interested in
consoling the worried

husband.”
“Oh, come on—”
“Youʼd be surprised.
Handsome guy like you. It
happens.”
Just then one of the
women, the blonder and
tanner, looked over at us,
made eye contact, and
smiled the gentlest, shyest
smile at me, then ducked
her head like a cat waiting
to be petted.

“Sheʼll
work
hard,
though; sheʼll be Little
Miss Involved,” Boney
said. “So thatʼs good.”
“Howʼd
the
Kayla
Holman case turn out?” I
asked.
She shook her head: no.
Four more women filed
in, passing a bottle of
sunblock
among
themselves, slathering it
on
bare
arms
and

shoulders and noses. The
room
smelled
like
coconuts.
“By the way, Nick,”
Boney said. “Remember
when I asked if Amy had
friends in town—what
about Noelle Hawthorne?
You didnʼt mention her.
She left us two messages.”
I gave her a blank
stare.
“Noelle
in
your

complex?
Mother
of
triplets?”
“No,
they
arenʼt
friends.”
“Oh,
funny.
She
definitely seems to think
they are.”
“That happens to Amy
a lot,” I said. “She talks to
people once, and they
latch on. Itʼs creepy.”
“Thatʼs
what
her
parents said.”

I debated asking Boney
directly
about
Hilary
Handy and Desi Collings.
Then I decided not to; Iʼd
look better if I were the
one leading the charge. I
wanted
Rand
and
Marybeth to see me in
action-hero
mode.
I
couldnʼt shake the look
Marybeth had given me:
The police definitely seem to
think itʼs … close to home.

“People think they
know her because they
read the books growing
up,” I said.
“I can see that,” Boney
said, nodding. “People
want to believe they know
other people. Parents want
to believe they know their
kids. Wives want to
believe they know their
husbands.”
Another hour and the

volunteer center began
feeling like a family picnic.
A few of my old girlfriends
dropped by to say hello,
introduce their kids. One
of my momʼs best friends,
Vicky, came by with three
of her granddaughters,
bashful tweens all in pink.
Grandkids. My mom
had
talked
about
grandkids a lot, as if it
were doubtlessly going to

happen—whenever
she
bought a new piece of
furniture, sheʼd explain
she favored that particular
style because “itʼll work
for
when
thereʼs
grandkids.” She wanted to
live to see some grandkids.
All her friends had some to
spare. Amy and I once had
my mom and Go over for
dinner to mark The Barʼs
biggest week ever. Iʼd

announced that we had
reason to celebrate, and
Mom had leaped from her
seat, burst into tears, and
hugged Amy, who also
began
weeping,
murmuring from beneath
my momʼs smothering
nuzzle, “Heʼs talking about
The Bar, heʼs just talking
about The Bar.” And then
my mom tried hard to
pretend she was just as

excited about that. “Plenty
of time for babies,” sheʼd
said in her most consoling
voice, a voice that just
made Amy start to cry
again. Which was strange,
since Amy had decided she
didnʼt want kids, and sheʼd
reiterated this fact several
times, but the tears gave
me a perverse wedge of
hope that maybe she was
changing
her
mind.

Because
there
wasnʼt
really plenty of time. Amy
was thirty-seven when we
moved to Carthage. Sheʼd
be thirty-nine in October.
And then I thought:
Weʼll have to throw some
fake birthday party or
something if this is still going
on. Weʼll have to mark it
somehow, some ceremony,
for the volunteers, the media
—something
to
revive

attention. Iʼll have to
pretend to be hopeful.
“The
prodijal
son
returns,” said a nasally
voice, and I turned to see a
skinny man in a stretchedout T-shirt next to me,
scratching a handlebar
mustache. My old friend
Stucks Buckley, who had
taken to calling me a
prodigal son despite not
knowing
how
to

pronounce the word, or
what its meaning was. I
assume he meant it as a
fancy synonym for jackass.
Stucks Buckley, it sounded
like a baseball playerʼs
name, and that was what
Stucks was supposed to be,
except he never had the
talent, just the hard wish.
He was the best in town,
growing up, but that
wasnʼt good enough. He

got the shock of his life in
college when he was cut
from the team, and it all
went to shit after. Now he
was an odd-job stoner with
twitchy moods. He had
dropped by The Bar a few
times to try to pick up
work, but he shook his
head at every crappy dayjob chore I offered,
chewing on the inside of
his cheek, annoyed: Come

on, man, what else you got,
you got to have something
else.
“Stucks,” I said by way
of greeting, waiting to see
if he was in a friendly
mood.
“Hear the police are
botching this royally,” he
said, tucking his hands
into his armpits.
“Itʼs a little early to say
that.”

“Come on, man, these
little pansy-ass searches? I
seen more effort put into
finding the mayorʼs dog.”
Stucksʼs
face
was
sunburned; I could feel the
heat coming off him as he
leaned in closer, giving me
a blast of Listerine and
chaw. “Why ainʼt they
rounded up some people?
Plenty of people in town to
choose from, they ainʼt

brought a single one in?
Not a single one? What
about the Blue Book Boys?
Thatʼs what I asked the
lady detective: What about
the Blue Book Boys? She
wouldnʼt even answer me.”
“What are the Blue
Book Boys? A gang?”
“All those guys got laid
off from the Blue Book
plant last winter. No
severance, nothing. You

see some of the homeless
guys wandering around
town in packs, looking
real, real pissed? Probably
Blue Book Boys.”
“Iʼm still not following
you: Blue Book plant?”
“You
know:
River
Valley Printworks. On the
edge of town? They made
those blue books you used
for essays and shit in
college.”

“Oh. I didnʼt know.”
“Now
colleges
use
computers, whatnot, so—
phwet!—bye-bye,
Blue
Book Boys.”
“God, this whole town
is shutting down,” I
muttered.
“The Blue Book Boys,
they drink, drug, harass
people. I mean, they did
that before, but they
always had to stop, go

back to work on Monday.
Now they just run wild.”
Stucks grinned his row
of chipped teeth at me. He
had paint flecks in his hair;
his summer job since high
school, housepainting. I
specialize in trim work, heʼd
say, and wait for you to
get the joke. If you didnʼt
laugh, heʼd explain it.
“So, the cops been out
to the mall?” Stucks asked.

I started a confused shrug.
“Shit, man, didnʼt you
used to be a reporter?”
Stucks always seemed
angry at my former
occupation, like it was a
lie that had stood too long.
“The Blue Book Boys, they
all made themselves a nice
little town over in the
mall.
Squatting.
Drug
deals. The police run them
out every once in a while,

but theyʼre always back
next day. Anyway, thatʼs
what I told the lady
detective:
Search
the
fucking mall. Because some
of them, they gang-raped a
girl there a month ago. I
mean, you get a bunch of
angry men together, and
things arenʼt too good for
a woman that comes
across them.”
On my drive to the

afternoon search area, I
phoned Boney, started in
as soon as she said hello.
“Why isnʼt the mall
being searched?”
“The mall will be
searched, Nick. We have
cops heading over there
right now.”
“Oh. Okay. Because a
buddy of mine—”
“Stucks, I know, I know
him.”

“He was talking about
all the—”
“The Blue Book Boys, I
know. Trust us, Nick, we
got this. We want to find
Amy as much as you do.”
“Okay, uh, thanks.”
My
righteousness
deflated, I gulped down
my giant Styrofoam cup of
coffee and drove to my
assigned area. Three spots
were being searched this

afternoon: the Gully boat
launch (now known as The
Place Nick Spent the
Morning Of, Unseen by
Anyone); the Miller Creek
woods
(which
hardly
deserved the name; you
could
see
fast-food
restaurants through the
treeline); and Wolky Park,
a nature spot with hiking
and horse trails. I was
assigned to Wolky Park.

When I arrived, a local
officer was addressing a
crowd of about twelve
people, all thick legs in
tight shorts, sunglasses,
and hats, zinc oxide on
noses. It looked like
opening day of camp.
Two different TV crews
were out to capture images
for local stations. It was
the July Fourth weekend;
Amy would be squeezed in

between state fair stories
and barbecue cookoffs.
One cub reporter kept
mosquitoing around me,
peppering
me
with
pointless questions, my
body going immediately
stiff, inhuman, with the
attention, my “concerned”
face looking fake. A waft
of horse manure hung in
the air.
The reporters soon left

to follow the volunteers
into the trails. (What kind
of journalist finds a
suspicious husband ripe
for the picking and leaves?
A bad low-pay journalist
left behind after all the
decent ones have been laid
off.) A young uniform cop
told me to stand—right
here—at the entry to the
various trails, near a
bulletin board that held a

mess of ancient flyers, as
well as a missing person
notice for Amy, my wife
staring out of that photo.
Sheʼd been everywhere
today, following me.
“What should I be
doing?” I asked the officer.
“I feel like a jackass here. I
need to do something.”
Somewhere in the woods,
a
horse
whinnied
mournfully.

“We really need you
right here, Nick. Just be
friendly, be encouraging,”
he said, and pointed to the
bright orange thermos next
to me. “Offer water. Just
point anyone who comes
in my way.” He turned and
walked toward the stables.
It occurred to me that they
were intentionally barring
me from any possible
crime scene. I wasnʼt sure

what that meant.
As I stood aimlessly,
pretending to busy myself
with
the
cooler,
a
latecomer SUV rolled in,
shiny red as nail polish.
Out
poured
the
fortysomethings
from
headquarters. The prettiest
woman, the one Boney
picked as a groupie, was
holding her hair up in a
ponytail so one of her

friends could bug-spray
the back of her neck. The
woman waved at the
fumes elaborately. She
glanced at me out of the
corner of her eye. Then
she stepped away from her
friends, let her hair fall
down
around
her
shoulders,
and
began
picking her way over to
me,
that
stricken,
sympathetic smile on her

face, the Iʼm so sorry smile.
Giant brown pony eyes,
her pink shirt ending just
above crisp white shorts.
High-heeled
sandals,
curled hair, gold hoops.
This, I thought, is how you
not dress for a search.
Please donʼt talk to me,
lady.
“Hi, Nick, Iʼm Shawna
Kelly. Iʼm so sorry.” She
had an unnecessarily loud

voice, a bit of a bray, like
some
enchanted,
hot
donkey. She held out her
hand, and I felt a flick of
alarm as Shawnaʼs friends
started ambling down the
trail, casting girl-clique
glances back toward us,
the couple.
I offered what I had:
my thanks, my water, my
lip-swallowing
awkwardness.
Shawna

didnʼt make any move to
leave, even though I was
staring ahead, toward the
trail where her friends had
disappeared.
“I hope you have
friends, relatives, who are
looking out for you during
this, Nick,” she said,
swatting a horsefly. “Men
forget to take care of
themselves. Comfort food
is what you need.”

“Weʼve been eating
mostly cold cuts—you
know, fast, easy.” I could
still taste the salami in the
back of my throat, the
fumes floating up from my
belly. I became aware that
I hadnʼt brushed my teeth
since the morning.
“Oh, you poor man.
Well, cold cuts, that wonʼt
do it.” She shook her head,
the gold hoops flickering

sunlight. “You need to
keep up your strength.
Now, you are lucky,
because I make a mean
chicken Frito pie. You
know what? I am going to
put that together and drop
it by the volunteer center
tomorrow. You can just
microwave it whenever
you want a nice warm
dinner.”
“Oh, that sounds like

too much trouble, really.
Weʼre fine. We really are.”
“Youʼll be more fine
after you eat a good meal,”
she said, patting my arm.
Silence.
She
tried
another angle.
“I really hope it doesnʼt
end up having anything to
do … with our homeless
problem,” she said. “I
swear,
I
have
filed
complaint after complaint.

One broke into my garden
last month. My motion
sensor went off, so I
peeked outside and there
he was, kneeling in the
dirt,
just
guzzling
tomatoes. Gnawing at
them like apples, his face
and shirt were covered in
juice and seeds. I tried to
scare him off, but he
loaded up at least twenty
before he ran off. They

were on the edge anyway,
those Blue Book guys. No
other skills.”
I felt a sudden affinity
for the troop of Blue Book
men,
pictured
myself
walking into their bitter
encampment, waving a
white flag: I am your
brother, I used to work in
print too. The computers
stole my job too.
“Donʼt tell me youʼre

too young to remember
Blue Books, Nick,” Shawna
was saying. She poked me
in the ribs, making me
jump more than I should
have.
“Iʼm
so
old,
Iʼd
forgotten about Blue Books
until you reminded me.”
She laughed: “What are
you, thirty-one, thirtytwo?”
“Try thirty-four.”

“A baby.”
The trio of energetic
elderly ladies arrived just
then, tromping toward us,
one working her cell
phone, all wearing sturdy
canvas garden skirts, Keds,
and sleeveless golf tops
revealing wobbly arms.
They nodded at me
respectfully, then flicked a
glance
of
disapproval
when they saw Shawna.

We looked like a couple
hosting
a
backyard
barbecue.
We
looked
inappropriate.
Please go away, Shawna,
I thought.
“So
anyway,
the
homeless guys, they can be
really aggressive, like,
threatening,
toward
women,” Shawna said. “I
mentioned it to Detective
Boney, but I get the feeling

she doesnʼt like me very
much.”
“Why do you say that?”
I already knew what she
was going to say, the
mantra of all attractive
women.
“Women donʼt like me
all that much.” She
shrugged. “Just one of
those things. Did—does
Amy have a lot of friends
in town?”

A number of women—
friends of my momʼs,
friends
of
Goʼs—had
invited Amy to book clubs
and Amway parties and
girlsʼ nights at Chiliʼs.
Amy
had
predictably
declined all but a few,
which she attended and
hated: “We ordered a
million little fried things
and drank cocktails made
from ice cream.”

Shawna was watching
me, wanting to know
about Amy, wanting to be
grouped together with my
wife, who would hate her.
“I think she may have
the same problem you do,”
I said in a clipped voice.
She smiled.
Leave, Shawna.
“Itʼs hard to come to a
new town,” she said. “Hard
to make friends, the older

you get. Is she your age?”
“Thirty-eight.”
That seemed to please
her too.
Go the fuck away.
“Smart man, likes them
older women.”
She pulled a cell phone
out of her giant chartreuse
handbag, laughing. “Come
here,” she said, and pulled
an arm around me. “Give
me a big chicken-Frito

casserole smile.”
I wanted to smack her,
right
then,
the
obliviousness, the girliness,
of her: trying to get an ego
stroke from the husband of
a missing woman. I
swallowed my rage, tried
to hit reverse, tried to
overcompensate and be
nice, so I smiled robotically
as she pressed her face
against my cheek and took

a photo with her phone,
the
fake
camera-click
sound waking me.
She turned the phone
around, and I saw our two
sunburned faces pressed
together, smiling as if we
were on a date at the
baseball game. Looking at
my smarmy grin, my
hooded eyes, I thought, I
would hate this guy.

AMY ELLIOTT
DUNNE
SEPTEMBER 15,
2010

DIARY ENTRY

I am writing from
somewhere
in
Pennsylvania. Southwest

corner. A motel off the
highway.
Our
room
overlooks the parking lot,
and if I peek out from
behind the stiff beige
curtains, I can see people
milling about under the
fluorescent lights. Itʼs the
kind of place where people
mill about. I have the
emotional bends again.
Too much has happened,
and so fast, and now I am

in southwest Pennsylvania,
and
my
husband
is
enjoying a defiant sleep
amid the little packets of
chips and candies he
bought from the vending
machine down the hall.
Dinner. He is angry at me
for not being a good sport.
I thought I was putting up
a
convincing
front—
hurray, a new adventure!
—but I guess not.

Now that I look back, it
was like we were waiting
for something to happen.
Like Nick and I were
sitting under a giant
soundproof, windproof jar,
and then the jar fell over
and—there was something
to do.
Two weeks ago, we are
in our usual unemployed
state: partly dressed, thick
with boredom, getting

ready to eat a silent
breakfast that weʼll stretch
over the reading of the
newspaper in its entirety.
We even read the auto
supplement now.
Nickʼs cell phone rings
at ten A.M., and I can tell
by his voice that it is Go.
He sounds springy, boyish,
the way he always does
when he talks to her. The
way he used to sound with

me.
He heads into the
bedroom and shuts the
door, leaving me holding
two freshly made eggs
Benedicts quivering on the
plates. I place his on the
table and sit opposite,
wondering if I should wait
to eat. If it were me, I
think, I would come back
out and tell him to eat, or
else Iʼd raise a finger: Just

one minute. Iʼd be aware of
the other person, my
spouse, left in the kitchen
with plates of eggs. I feel
bad that I was thinking
that. Because soon I can
hear worried murmurs and
upset exclamations and
gentle reassurances from
behind the door, and I
begin wondering if Go is
having some back-home
boy troubles. Go has a lot

of breakups. Even the ones
that she instigates require
much handholding and
goo-gawing from Nick.
So I have my usual
Poor Go face on when Nick
emerges,
the
eggs
hardened on the plate. I
see him and know this
isnʼt just a Go problem.
“My mom,” he starts,
and sits down. “Shit. My
mom has cancer. Stage

four, and itʼs spread to the
liver and bones. Which is
bad, which is …”
He puts his face in his
hands, and I go over and
put my arms around him.
When he looks up, he is
dry-eyed. Calm. Iʼve never
seen my husband cry.
“Itʼs too much for Go,
on top of my dadʼs
Alzheimerʼs.”
“Alzheimerʼs?

Alzheimerʼs? Since when?”
“Well, a while. At first
they thought it was some
sort of early dementia. But
itʼs more, itʼs worse.”
I think, immediately,
that there is something
wrong with us, perhaps
unfixable, if my husband
wouldnʼt think to tell me
this. Sometimes I feel itʼs
his personal game, that
heʼs in some sort of

undeclared contest for
impenetrability.
“Why
didnʼt you say anything to
me?”
“My dad isnʼt someone
I like to talk about that
much.”
“But still—”
“Amy. Please.” He has
that look, like I am being
unreasonable, like he is so
sure
I
am
being
unreasonable
that
I

wonder if I am.
“But now. Go says with
my mom, sheʼll need
chemo but … sheʼll be
really, really sick. Sheʼll
need help.”
“Should
we
start
looking for in-home care
for her? A nurse?”
“She doesnʼt have that
kind of insurance.”
He stares at me, arms
crossed, and I know what

he is daring: daring me to
offer to pay, and we canʼt
pay, because Iʼve given my
money to my parents.
“Okay, then, babe,” I
say. “What do you want to
do?”
We stand across from
each other, a showdown,
as if we are in a fight and I
havenʼt been informed. I
reach out to touch him,
and he just looks at my

hand.
“We have to move
back.” He glares at me,
opening his eyes wide. He
flicks his fingers out as if
he is trying to rid himself
of something sticky. “Weʼll
take a year, and weʼll go
do the right thing. We
have no jobs, we have no
money, thereʼs nothing
holding us here. Even you
have to admit that.”

“Even I have to?” As if I
am already being resistant.
I feel a burst of anger that
I swallow.
“This is what weʼre
going to do. We are going
to do the right thing. We
are going to help my
parents for once.”
Of course thatʼs what
we have to do, and of
course if he had presented
the problem to me like I

wasnʼt his enemy, thatʼs
what I would have said.
But he came out of the
door already treating me
like a problem that needed
to be dealt with. I was the
bitter voice that needed to
be squelched.
My husband is the most
loyal man on the planet
until heʼs not. Iʼve seen his
eyes literally turn a shade
darker when heʼs felt

betrayed by a friend, even
a dear longtime friend,
and then the friend is
never mentioned again. He
looked at me then like I
was an object to be
jettisoned if necessary. It
actually chilled me, that
look.
So it is decided that
quickly, with that little of
a debate: We are leaving
New York. We are going to

Missouri. To a house in
Missouri by the river
where we will live. It is
surreal, and Iʼm not one to
misuse the word surreal.
I know it will be okay.
Itʼs just so far from what I
pictured. When I pictured
my life. Thatʼs not to say
bad, just … If you gave me
a million guesses where
life would take me, I
wouldnʼt have guessed. I

find that alarming.
The packing of the UHaul is a mini-tragedy:
Nick,
determined
and
guilty, his mouth a tight
line, getting it done,
unwilling to look at me.
The U-Haul sits for hours,
blocking traffic on our
little street, blinking its
hazard
lights—danger,
danger, danger—as Nick
goes up and down the

stairs, a one-man assembly
line, carrying boxes of
books, boxes of kitchen
supplies,
chairs,
side
tables. We are bringing our
vintage sofa—our broad
old chesterfield that Dad
calls our pet, we dote on it
so much. It is to be the last
thing we pack, a sweaty,
awkward two-person job.
Getting the massive thing
down our stairs (Hold on, I

need to rest. Lift to the right.
Hold on, youʼre going too
fast. Watch out, my fingers
my fingers!) will be its own
much-needed
teambuilding exercise. After the
sofa, weʼll pick up lunch
from the corner deli, bagel
sandwiches to eat on the
road. Cold soda.
Nick lets me keep the
sofa, but our other big
items are staying in New

York. One of Nickʼs friends
will inherit the bed; the
guy will come by later to
our empty home—nothing
but dust and cable cords
left—and take the bed, and
then heʼll live his New
York life in our New York
bed, eating two A.M.
Chinese food and having
lazy-condomed sex with
tipsy, brass-mouthed girls
who worked in PR. (Our

home itself will be taken
over by a noisy couple,
hubby-wife lawyers who
are shamelessly, brazenly
gleeful at this buyersʼmarket deal. I hate them.)
I carry one load for
every four that Nick grunts
down. I move slowly,
shuffling, like my bones
hurt, a feverish delicacy
descending
on
me.
Everything does hurt. Nick

buzzes past me, going up
or down, and throws his
frown at me, snaps “You
okay?” and keeps moving
before I answer, leaves me
gaping, a cartoon with a
black mouth-hole. I am not
okay. I will be okay, but
right now I am not okay. I
want my husband to put
his arms around me, to
console me, to baby me a
little bit. Just for a second.

Inside the back of the
truck, he fusses with the
boxes. Nick prides himself
on his packing skills: He is
(was) the loader of the
dishwasher, the packer of
the holiday bags. But by
hour three, it is clear that
weʼve sold or gifted too
many of our belongings.
The
U-Haulʼs
massive
cavern is only half full. It
gives
me
my
single

satisfaction of the day, that
hot, mean satisfaction
right in the belly, like a
nib of mercury. Good, I
think. Good.
“We can take the bed if
you really want to,” Nick
says, looking past me
down the street. “We have
enough room.”
“No, you promised it to
Wally, Wally should have
it,” I say primly.

I was wrong. Just say: I
was wrong, Iʼm sorry, letʼs
take the bed. You should
have your old, comforting
bed in this new place. Smile
at me and be nice to me.
Today, be nice to me.
Nick blows out a sigh.
“Okay, if thatʼs what you
want. Amy? Is it?” He
stands, slightly breathless,
leaning on a stack of
boxes, the top one with

Magic Marker scrawl: AMY
CLOTHES WINTER. “This
is the last Iʼll hear about
the bed, Amy? Because Iʼm
offering right now. Iʼm
happy to pack the bed for
you.”
“How gracious of you,”
I say, just a whiff of
breath, the way I say most
retorts: a puff of perfume
from a rank atomizer. I am
a coward. I donʼt like

confrontation. I pick up a
box and start toward the
truck.
“What did you say?”
I shake my head at
him. I donʼt want him to
see me cry, because it will
make him more angry.
Ten minutes later, the
stairs are pounding—bang!
bang! bang! Nick is
dragging our sofa down by
himself.

I canʼt even look
behind me as we leave
New York, because the
truck has no back window.
In the side mirror, I track
the skyline (the receding
skyline—isnʼt that what
they write in Victorian
novels where the doomed
heroine is forced to leave
her ancestral home?), but
none of the good buildings
—not the Chrysler or the

Empire State or the
Flatiron, they never appear
in that little shining
rectangle.
My parents dropped by
the night before, presented
us with the family cuckoo
clock that Iʼd loved as a
child, and the three of us
cried and hugged as Nick
shuffled his hands in his
pockets and promised to
take care of me.

He promised to take
care of me, and yet I feel
afraid.
I
feel
like
something is going wrong,
very wrong, and that it
will get even worse. I
donʼt feel like Nickʼs wife.
I donʼt feel like a person at
all: I am something to be
loaded and unloaded, like
a sofa or a cuckoo clock. I
am something to be tossed
into a junkyard, thrown

into the river, if necessary.
I donʼt feel real anymore. I
feel like I could disappear.

NICK DUNNE
THREE
DAYS
GONE

The police werenʼt
going to find Amy unless
someone
wanted
her
found. That much was

clear. Everything green
and brown had been
searched: miles of the
muddy Mississippi River,
all the trails and hiking
paths, our sad collection of
patchy woods. If she were
alive, someone would need
to return her. If she were
dead, nature would have
to give her up. It was a
palpable truth, like a sour
taste on the tongue tip. I

arrived at the volunteer
center
and
realized
everyone else knew this
too:
There
was
a
listlessness, a defeat, that
hung over the place. I
wandered aimlessly over
to the pastries station and
tried to convince myself to
eat something. Danish. Iʼd
come to believe there was
no food more depressing
than Danish, a pastry that

seemed stale upon arrival.
“I still say itʼs the
river,” one volunteer was
saying to his buddy, both
of them picking through
the pastries with dirty
fingers. “Right behind the
guyʼs house, what easier
way?”
“She
would
have
turned up in an eddy by
now, a lock, something.”
“Not if sheʼs been cut.

Chop off the legs, the
arms … the body can
shoot all the way to the
Gulf. Tunica, at least.”
I turned away before
they noticed me.
A former teacher of
mine, Mr. Coleman, sat at
a card table, hunched over
the
tip-line
phone,
scribbling
down
information.
When
I
caught his eye, he made

the cuckoo signal: finger
circling his ear, then
pointing at the phone. He
had greeted me yesterday
by
saying,
“My
granddaughter was killed
by a drunk driver, so …”
Weʼd
murmured
and
patted
each
other
awkwardly.
My cell rang, the
disposable—I
couldnʼt
figure out where to keep

it, so I kept it on me. Iʼd
made a call, and the call
was being returned, but I
couldnʼt take it. I turned
the phone off, scanned the
room to make sure the
Elliotts hadnʼt seen me do
it. Marybeth was clicking
away on her BlackBerry,
then holding it at armʼs
length so she could read
the text. When she saw
me, she shot over in her

tight quick steps, holding
the BlackBerry in front of
her like a talisman.
“How many hours from
here is Memphis?” she
asked.
“Little under five hours,
driving.
Whatʼs
in
Memphis?”
“Hilary Handy lives in
Memphis. Amyʼs stalker
from high school. How
much of a coincidence is

that?”
I didnʼt know what to
say: none?
“Yeah, Gilpin blew me
off too. We canʼt authorize
the expense for something
that happened twenty-some
years ago. Asshole. Guy
always treats me like Iʼm
on the verge of hysteria;
heʼll talk to Rand when
Iʼm right there, totally
ignore me, like I need my

husband to explain things
to
little
dumb
me.
Asshole.”
“The cityʼs broke,” I
said. “Iʼm sure they really
donʼt have the budget,
Marybeth.”
“Well, we do. Iʼm
serious, Nick, this girl was
off her rocker. And I know
she tried to contact Amy
over the years. Amy told
me.”

“She never told me
that.”
“Whatʼs it cost to drive
there? Fifty bucks? Fine.
Will you go? You said
youʼd go. Please? I wonʼt
be able to stop thinking
until I know someoneʼs
talked to her.”
I knew this to be true,
at least, because her
daughter suffered from the
same tenacious worry

streak: Amy could spend
an entire evening out
fretting that she left the
stove on, even though we
didnʼt cook that day. Or
was the door locked? Was
I sure? She was a worstcase scenarist on a grand
scale. Because it was never
just that the door was
unlocked, it was that the
door was unlocked, and
men were inside, and they

were waiting to rape and
kill her.
I felt a layer of sweat
shimmer to the surface of
my skin, because, finally,
my wifeʼs fears had come
to fruition. Imagine the
awful satisfaction, to know
that all those years of
worry had paid off.
“Of course Iʼll go. And
Iʼll stop by St. Louis, see
the other one, Desi, on the

way. Consider it done.” I
turned around, started my
dramatic exit, got twenty
feet, and suddenly, there
was Stucks again, his
entire face still slack with
sleep.
“Heard
the
cops
searched
the
mall
yesterday,”
he
said,
scratching his jaw. In his
other hand he held a
glazed donut, unbitten. A

bagel-shaped bulge sat in
the front pocket of his
cargo pants. I almost made
a joke: Is that a baked good
in your pocket or are you …
“Yeah. Nothing.”
“Yesterday. They went
yesterday, the jackasses.”
He ducked, looked around,
as if he worried theyʼd
overheard him. He leaned
closer to me. “You go at
night, thatʼs when theyʼre

there. Daytime, theyʼre
down by the river, or out
flying a flag.”
“Flying a flag?”
“You know, sitting by
the exits on the highway
with those signs: Laid Off,
Please Help, Need Beer
Money, whatever,” he said,
scanning the room. “Flying
a flag, man.”
“Okay.”
“At night theyʼre at the

mall,” he said.
“Then letʼs go tonight,”
I said. “You and me and
whoever.”
“Joe
and
Mikey
Hillsam,”
Stucks
said.
“Theyʼd be up for it.” The
Hillsams were three, four
years older than me, town
badasses. The kind of guys
who were born without
the fear gene, impervious
to pain. Jock kids who

sped through the summers
on short, muscled legs,
playing baseball, drinking
beer, taking strange dares:
skateboarding
into
drainage ditches, climbing
water towers naked. The
kind of guys who would
peel up, wild-eyed, on a
boring Saturday night and
you
knew
something
would happen, maybe
nothing
good,
but

something. Of course the
Hillsams would be up for
it.
“Good,” I said. “Tonight
we go.”
My disposable rang in
my pocket. The thing
didnʼt turn off right. It
rang again.
“You gonna get that?”
Stucks asked.
“Nah.”
“You should answer

every call, man. You really
should.”
There was nothing to
do for the rest of the day.
No searches planned, no
more flyers needed, the
phones
fully
manned.
Marybeth started sending
volunteers home; they
were just standing around,
eating, bored. I suspected
Stucks of leaving with half
the breakfast table in his

pockets.
“Anyone hear from the
detectives?” Rand asked.
“Nothing,”
Marybeth
and I both answered.
“That may be good,
right?”
Rand
asked,
hopeful
eyes,
and
Marybeth and I both
indulged him. Yes, sure.
“When are you leaving
for Memphis?” she asked
me.

“Tomorrow.
Tonight
my friends and I are doing
another search of the mall.
We donʼt think it was done
right yesterday.”
“Excellent,” Marybeth
said. “Thatʼs the kind of
action we need. We
suspect it wasnʼt done
right the first time, we do
it ourselves. Because I just
—Iʼm
just
not
that
impressed with whatʼs

been done so far.”
Rand put a hand on his
wifeʼs shoulder, a signal
this refrain had been
expressed and received
many times.
“Iʼd like to come with
you, Nick,” he said.
“Tonight. Iʼd like to come.”
Rand was wearing a
powder-blue golf shirt and
olive slacks, his hair a
gleaming dark helmet. I

pictured him trying to
hail-fellow the Hillsam
brothers, doing his slightly
desperate one-of-the-guys
routine—hey, I love a good
beer too, and how about that
sports team of yours?—and
felt a flush of impending
awkwardness.
“Of course, Rand. Of
course.”
I had a good ten
unscheduled hours to work

with. My car was being
released back to me—
having been processed and
vacuumed and printed, I
assume—so I hitched a
ride to the police station
with an elderly volunteer,
one of those bustling
grandmotherly types who
seemed slightly nervous to
be alone with me.
“Iʼm just driving Mr.
Dunne to the police

station, but I will be back
in less than half an hour,”
she said to one of her
friends. “No more than
half an hour.”
Gilpin had not taken
Amyʼs second note into
evidence; heʼd been too
thrilled
with
the
underwear to bother. I got
in my car, flung the door
open, and sat as the heat
drooled out, reread my

wifeʼs second clue:
Picture me: Iʼm
crazy about you
My future is
anything but hazy with
you
You took me here
so I could hear you chat
About your
boyhood
adventures:
crummy jeans and visor
hat
Screw everyone

else, for us theyʼre all
ditched
And letʼs sneak a
kiss … pretend we just
got hitched.
It
was
Hannibal,
Missouri, boyhood home
of Mark Twain, where Iʼd
worked summers growing
up, where Iʼd wandered
the town dressed as Huck
Finn, in an old straw hat
and faux-ragged pants,

smiling scampishly while
urging people to visit the
Ice Cream Shoppe. It was
one of those stories you
dine out on, at least in
New York, because no one
else could match it. No
one could ever say: Oh
yeah, me too.
The
“visor
hat”
comment was a little
inside joke: When Iʼd first
told Amy I played Huck,

we were out to dinner,
into our second bottle of
wine, and sheʼd been
adorably tipsy. Big grin
and the flushed cheeks she
got when she drank.
Leaning across the table as
if I had a magnet on me.
She kept asking me if I still
had the visor, would I
wear the visor for her, and
when I asked her why in
the name of all that was

holy would she think that
Huck Finn wore a visor,
she swallowed once and
said, “Oh, I meant a straw
hat!” As if those were two
entirely
interchangeable
words. After that, anytime
we watched tennis, we
always complimented the
playersʼ sporty straw hats.
Hannibal was a strange
choice for Amy, however,
as I donʼt remember us

having a particularly good
or bad time there, just a
time. I remember us
ambling around almost a
full year ago, pointing at
things
and
reading
placards
and
saying,
“Thatʼs interesting,” while
the other one agreed,
“That is.” Iʼd been there
since then without Amy
(my
nostalgic
streak
uncrushable) and had a

glorious day, a wide-grin,
right-with-the-world day.
But with Amy, it had been
still,
rote.
A
bit
embarrassing. I remember
at one point starting a
goofy story about a
childhood field trip here,
and I saw her eyes go
blank, and I got secretly
furious, spent ten minutes
just winding myself up—
because at this point of our

marriage, I was so used to
being angry with her, it
felt almost enjoyable, like
gnawing on a cuticle: You
know you should stop, that
it doesnʼt really feel as
good as you think, but you
canʼt quit grinding away.
On the surface, of course,
she saw nothing. We just
kept walking, and reading
placards, and pointing.
It was a fairly awful

reminder, the dearth of
good memories we had
since our move, that my
wife was forced to pick
Hannibal for her treasure
hunt.
I reached Hannibal in
twenty minutes, drove past
the glorious Gilded Age
courthouse that now held
only a chicken-wing place
in its basement, and
headed past a series of

shuttered
businesses—
ruined community banks
and defunct movie houses
—toward the river. I
parked in a lot right on the
Mississippi, smack in front
of
the
Mark
Twain
riverboat. Parking was
free. (I never failed to
thrill to the novelty, the
generosity of free parking.)
Banners of the whitemaned man hung listlessly

from lamp poles, posters
curled up in the heat. It
was a blow-dryer-hot day,
but even so, Hannibal
seemed disturbingly quiet.
As I walked along the few
blocks of souvenir stores—
quilts and antiques and
taffy—I saw more for-sale
signs. Becky Thatcherʼs
house was closed for
renovations, to be paid for
with money that had yet to

be raised. For ten bucks,
you could graffiti your
name on Tom Sawyerʼs
whitewashed fence, but
there were few takers.
I sat in the doorstep of
a vacant storefront. It
occurred to me that I had
brought Amy to the end of
everything.
We
were
literally experiencing the
end of a way of life, a
phrase Iʼd applied only to

New Guinea tribesmen and
Appalachian glassblowers.
The recession had ended
the mall. Computers had
ended the Blue Book plant.
Carthage had gone bust; its
sister city Hannibal was
losing ground to brighter,
louder, cartoonier tourist
spots.
My
beloved
Mississippi
River
was
being eaten in reverse by
Asian carp flip-flopping

their way up toward Lake
Michigan. Amazing Amy
was done. It was the end
of my career, the end of
hers, the end of my father,
the end of my mom. The
end of our marriage. The
end of Amy.
The ghost wheeze of
the steamboat horn blew
out from the river. I had
sweated through the back
of my shirt. I made myself

stand up. I made myself
buy my tour ticket. I
walked the route Amy and
I had taken, my wife still
beside me in my mind. It
was hot that day too. You
are BRILLIANT. In my
imagination, she strolled
next to me, and this time
she smiled. My stomach
went oily.
I mind-walked my wife
around the main tourist

drag. A gray-haired couple
paused to peer into the
Huckleberry Finn house
but didnʼt bother to walk
in. At the end of the block,
a man dressed as Twain—
white hair, white suit—got
out of a Ford Focus,
stretched, looked down the
lonely street, and ducked
into a pizza joint. And
then there we were, at the
clapboard building that

had been the courtroom of
Samuel Clemensʼs dad.
The sign out front read: J.
M. Clemens, Justice of the
Peace.
Letʼs
sneak
a
kiss … pretend we just got
hitched.
Youʼre making these so
nice and easy, Amy. As if
you actually want me to find
them, to feel good about
myself. Keep this up and Iʼll

break my record.
No one was inside. I
got down on my knees on
the dusty floorboards and
peered under the first
bench. If Amy left a clue in
a public place, she always
taped it to the underside of
things, in between the
wadded gum and the dust,
and she was always
vindicated, because no one
likes to look at the

underside of things. There
was nothing under the first
bench, but there was a flap
of paper hanging down
from the bench behind. I
climbed over and tugged
down
the
Amy-blue
envelope, a piece of tape
winging off it.
Hi
Darling
Husband,
You found it!
Brilliant man. It

may help that I
decided to not make
this yearʼs treasure
hunt
an
excruciating forced
march through my
arcane
personal
memories.
I took a cue
from your beloved
Mark Twain:
“What ought to
be done to the man

who invented the
celebrating
of
anniversaries? Mere
killing would be too
light.”
I finally get it,
what youʼve said
year after year, that
this treasure hunt
should be a time to
celebrate us, not a
test about whether
you
remember

every thing I think
or say throughout
the year. Youʼd
think that would be
something a grown
woman
would
realize on her own,
but … I guess thatʼs
what husbands are
for. To point out
what we canʼt see
for ourselves, even
if it takes five years.

So I wanted to
take a moment now,
in the childhood
stomping grounds of
Mark Twain, and
thank you for your
WIT. You are truly
the
cleverest,
funniest person I
know. I have a
wonderful
sense
memory: of all the
times over the years

youʼve leaned in to
my ear—I can feel
your breath tickling
my lobe, right now,
as Iʼm writing this
—and
whispered
something just to
me, just to make me
laugh.
What
a
generous thing that
is, I realize, for a
husband to try to
make
his
wife

laugh. And you
always picked the
best moments. Do
you
remember
when Insley and her
dancing-monkey
husband made us
come
over
to
admire their baby,
and we did the
obligatory visit to
their
strangely
perfect,

overflowered,
overmuffined house
for
brunch
and
baby-meeting and
they were so selfrighteous
and
patronizing of our
childless state, and
meanwhile
there
was their hideous
boy, covered in
streaks of slobber
and stewed carrots

and maybe some
feces—naked except
for a frilly bib and a
pair
of
knitted
booties—and as I
sipped my orange
juice, you leaned
over and whispered,
“Thatʼs what Iʼll be
wearing later.” And
I literally did a spit
take. It was one of
those
moments

where you saved
me, you made me
laugh at just the
right time. Just one
olive, though. So let
me say it again: You
are WITTY. Now
kiss me!
I felt my soul deflate.
Amy
was
using
the
treasure hunt to steer us
back to each other. And it
was too late. While she

had been writing these
clues, sheʼd had no idea of
my state of mind. Why,
Amy, couldnʼt you have
done this sooner?
Our timing had never
been good.
I opened the next clue,
read it, tucked it in my
pocket, then headed back
home. I knew where to go,
but I wasnʼt ready yet. I
couldnʼt handle another

compliment, another kind
word from my wife,
another olive branch. My
feelings for her were
veering too quickly from
bitter to sweet.
I went back to Goʼs,
spent a few hours alone,
drinking
coffee
and
flipping around the TV,
anxious and pissy, killing
time till my eleven P.M.
carpool to the mall.

My twin got home just
after seven, looking wilted
from her solo bar shift.
Her glance at the TV told
me I should turn it off.
“Whatʼd
you
do
today?” she asked, lighting
a cigarette and flopping
down at our motherʼs old
card table.
“Manned the volunteer
center … then we go
search the mall at eleven,”

I said. I didnʼt want to tell
her about Amyʼs clue. I felt
guilty enough.
Go doled out some
solitaire cards, the steady
slap of them on the table a
rebuke. I began pacing.
She ignored me.
“I was just watching TV
to distract myself.”
“I know, I do.”
She flipped over a Jack.
“Thereʼs got to be

something I can do,” I said,
stalking around her living
room.
“Well, youʼre searching
the mall in a few hours,”
Go said, and gave no more
encouragement.
She
flipped over three cards.
“You sound like you
think itʼs a waste of time.”
“Oh.
No.
Hey,
everything
is
worth
checking out. They got Son

of Sam on a parking ticket,
right?”
Go was the third
person whoʼd mentioned
this to me; it must be the
mantra for cases going
cold. I sat down across
from her.
“I havenʼt been upset
enough about Amy,” I said.
“I know that.”
“Maybe
not.”
She
finally looked up at me.

“Youʼre being weird.”
“I think that instead of
panicking,
Iʼve
just
focused on being pissed at
her. Because we were in
such a bad place lately. Itʼs
like it feels wrong for me
to worry too much because
I donʼt have the right. I
guess.”
“Youʼve been weird, I
canʼt lie,” Go said. “But itʼs
a weird situation.” She

stubbed out her cigarette.
“I donʼt care how you are
with me. Just be careful
with everyone else, okay?
People judge. Fast.”
She went back to her
solitaire, but I wanted her
attention. I kept talking.
“I should probably
check in on Dad at some
point,” I said. “I donʼt
know if Iʼll tell him about
Amy.”

“No,” she said. “Donʼt.
He was even weirder about
Amy than you are.”
“I always felt like she
must remind him of an old
girlfriend or something—
the one who got away.
After he—” I made the
downward swoop of a
hand that signified his
Alzheimerʼs—“he was kind
of rude and awful, but …”
“Yeah, but he kind of

wanted to impress her at
the same time,” she said.
“Your basic jerky twelveyear-old boy trapped in a
sixty-eight-year-old
assholeʼs body.”
“Donʼt women think
that all men are jerky
twelve-year-olds at heart?”
“Hey, if the heart fits.”
Eleven-oh-eight P.M.,
Rand was waiting for us
just inside the automatic

sliding doors to the hotel,
his face squinting into the
dark to make us out. The
Hillsams were driving
their pick-up; Stucks and I
both rode in the bed. Rand
came trotting up to us in
khaki golf shorts and a
crisp Middlebury T-shirt.
He hopped in the back,
planted himself on the
wheel
cover
with
surprising
ease,
and

handled the introductions
like he was the host of his
own mobile talk show.
“Iʼm really sorry about
Amy, Rand,” Stucks said
loudly, as we hurtled out
of the parking lot with
unnecessary speed and hit
the highway. “Sheʼs such a
sweet person. One time
she saw me out painting a
house, sweating my ba—
my butt off, and she drove

on to 7-Eleven, got me a
giant pop, and brought it
back to me, right up on the
ladder.”
This was a lie. Amy
cared so little for Stucks or
his refreshment that she
wouldnʼt have bothered to
piss in a cup for him.
“That sounds like her,”
Rand said, and I was flush
with
unwelcome,
ungentlemanly annoyance.

Maybe it was the journalist
in me, but facts were facts,
and people didnʼt get to
turn Amy into everyoneʼs
beloved best friend just
because it was emotionally
expedient.
“Middlebury,
huh?”
Stucks continued, pointing
at Randʼs T-shirt. “Got a
hell of a rugby team.”
“Thatʼs right we do,”
Rand said, the big smile

again, and he and Stucks
began
an
improbable
discussion of liberal-arts
rugby over the noise of the
car, the air, the night, all
the way to the mall.
Joe Hillsam parked his
truck outside the giant
cornerstone Mervyns. We
all hopped out, stretched
our legs, shook ourselves
awake. The night was
muggy and moon-slivered.

I noticed Stucks was
wearing—maybe
ironically, possibly not—a
T-shirt that read Save Gas,
Fart in a Jar.
“So, this place, what
weʼre doing, itʼs freakinʼ
dangerous, I donʼt want to
lie,” Mikey Hillsam began.
He had beefed up over the
years, as had his brother;
they werenʼt just barrelchested
but
barrel-

everythinged.
Standing
side by side, they were
about five hundred pounds
of dude.
“We came here once,
me and Mikey, just for—I
donʼt know, to see it, I
guess, see what it had
become, and we almost
got our asses handed to
us,” said Joe. “So tonight
we take no chances.” He
reached into the cab for a

long canvas bag and
unzipped it to reveal half a
dozen baseball bats. He
began handing them out
solemnly. When he got to
Rand, he hesitated. “Uh,
you want one?”
“Hell yes, I do,” Rand
said, and they all nodded
and smiled approval, the
energy in the circle a
friendly backslap, a good
for you, old man.

“Come on,” Mikey said,
and led us along the
exterior. “Thereʼs a door
with a lock smashed off
down here near the
Spencerʼs.”
Just then we passed the
dark windows of Shoe-BeDoo-Be, where my mom
had worked for more than
half my life. I still
remember the thrill of her
going to apply for a job at

that most wondrous of
places—the mall!—leaving
one Saturday morning for
the job fair in her bright
peach pantsuit, a fortyyear-old woman looking
for work for the first time,
and her coming home with
a flushed grin: We couldnʼt
imagine how busy the mall
was, so many different
kinds of stores! And who
knew which one she might

work in? She applied to
nine! Clothing stores and
stereo stores and even a
designer popcorn store.
When she announced a
week later that she was
officially a shoe saleslady,
her
kids
were
underwhelmed.
“Youʼll have to touch
all sorts of stinky feet,” Go
complained.
“Iʼll get to meet all

sorts
of
interesting
people,”
our
mom
corrected.
I peered into the
gloomy window. The place
was entirely vacant except
for a shoe sizer lined
pointlessly against the
wall.
“My mom used to work
here,” I told Rand, forcing
him to linger with me.
“What kind of place

was it?”
“It was a nice place,
they were good to her.”
“I mean what did they
do here?”
“Oh, shoes. They did
shoes.”
“Thatʼs right! Shoes. I
like
that.
Something
people actually need. And
at the end of the day, you
know what youʼve done:
Youʼve sold five people

shoes. Not like writing,
huh?”
“Dunne, come on!”
Stucks was leaning against
the open door ahead; the
others had gone inside.
Iʼd expected the mall
smell as we entered: that
temperature-controlled
hollowness.
Instead,
I
smelled old grass and dirt,
the scent of the outdoors
inside, where it had no

place being. The building
was heavy-hot, almost
fuzzy, like the inside of a
mattress. Three of us had
giant camping flashlights,
the
glow
illuminating
jarring images: It was
suburbia, post-comet, postzombie, post-humanity. A
set of muddy shoppingcart tracks looped crazily
along the white flooring. A
raccoon chewed on a dog

treat in the entry to a
womenʼs bathroom, his
eyes flashing like dimes.
The whole mall was
quiet;
Mikeyʼs
voice
echoed,
our
footsteps
echoed, Stucksʼs drunken
giggle echoed. We would
not be a surprise attack, if
attack was what we had in
mind.
When we reached the
central promenade of the

mall, the whole area
ballooned: four stories
high,
escalators
and
elevators crisscrossing in
the black. We all gathered
near a dried-up fountain
and waited for someone to
take the lead.
“So, guys,” Rand said
doubtfully, “whatʼs the
plan here? You all know
this place, and I donʼt. We
need to figure out how to

systematically—”
We heard a loud metal
rattle right behind us, a
security gate going up.
“Hey, thereʼs one!”
Stucks yelled. He trained
his flashlight on a man in a
billowing rain slicker,
shooting out from the
entry of a Claireʼs, running
full speed away from us.
“Stop him!” Joe yelled,
and began running after

him, thick tennis shoes
slapping
against
the
ceramic tile, Mikey right
behind him, flashlight
trained on the stranger,
the two brothers calling
gruffly—hold up there, hey,
guy, we just have a question.
The man didnʼt even give
a backward glance. I said
hold on, motherfucker! The
runner remained silent
amid the yelling, but he

picked up speed and shot
down the mall corridor, in
and out of the flashlightʼs
glow, his slicker flapping
behind him like a cape.
Then the guy turned
acrobatic: leaping over a
trash can, shimmying off
the edge of a fountain, and
finally slipping under a
metal security gate to the
Gap and disappearing.
“Fucker!” The Hillsams

had turned heart-attack
red in the face, the neck,
the fingers. They took
turns grunting at the gate,
straining to lift it.
I reached down with
them, but there was no
budging it over half a foot.
I lay down on the floor
and tried threading myself
under the gate: toes,
calves, then stuck at my
waist.

“Nope, no go.” I
grunted. “Fuck!” I pulled
up and shone my flashlight
into
the
store.
The
showroom was empty
except for a pile of
clothing racks someone
had dragged to the center,
as if to start a bonfire. “All
the stores connect in the
back to passageways for
trash, plumbing,” I said.
“Heʼs probably at the other

end of the mall by now.”
“Well, then letʼs go to
the other end of the mall,”
Rand said.
“Come
out,
you
fuckers!” Joe yelled, his
head tilted back, eyes
scrunched.
His
voice
echoed
through
the
building.
We
began
walking ragtag, trailing
our bats alongside us,
except for the Hillsams,

who used theirs to bang
against security gates and
doors, like they were on
military
patrol
in
a
particularly nasty war
zone.
“Better you come to us
than we come to you!”
Mikey called. “Oh, hello!”
In the entryway to a pet
shop, a man and woman
huddled on a few army
blankets, their hair wet

with sweat. Mikey loomed
over
them,
breathing
heavily, wiping his brow.
It was the scene in the war
movie when the frustrated
soldiers
come
across
innocent villagers and bad
things happen.
“The fuck you want?”
the man on the floor
asked. He was emaciated,
his face so thin and drawn
it looked like it was

melting. His hair was
tangled to his shoulders,
his eyes mournful and
upturned:
a
despoiled
Jesus. The woman was in
better shape, with clean,
plump arms and legs, her
lank hair oily but brushed.
“You a Blue Book Boy?”
Stucks asked.
“Ainʼt
no
boy,
anyhow,”
the
man
muttered, folding his arms.

“Have some fucking
respect,”
the
woman
snapped. Then she looked
like she might cry. She
turned away from us,
pretending to look at
something in the distance.
“Iʼm sick of no one having
no respect.”
“We asked you a
question, buddy,” Mikey
said, moving closer to the
guy, kicking the sole of his

foot.
“I ainʼt Blue Book,” the
man said. “Just down on
my luck.”
“Bullshit.”
“Lots
of
different
people here, not just Blue
Books. But if thatʼs who
youʼre looking for …”
“Go on, go on, then,
and find them,” the
woman said, her mouth
turning down. “Go bother

them.”
“They deal down in the
Hole,” the man said. When
we looked blank, he
pointed. “The Mervyns, far
end, past where the
carousel used to be.”
“And fuck you very
much,”
the
woman
muttered.
A
crop-circle
stain
marked where the carousel
once was. Amy and I had

taken a ride just before the
mall shut down. Two
grown-ups, side by side on
levitating bunny rabbits,
because my wife wanted to
see the mall where I spent
so much of my childhood.
Wanted to hear my stories.
It wasnʼt all bad with us.
The barrier gate to the
Mervyns had been busted
through, so the store was
open
as
wide
and

welcoming as the morning
of a Presidentsʼ Day sale.
Inside, the place was
cleared out except for the
islands that once held cash
registers and now held
about a dozen people in
various states of drug
highs, under signs that
read Jewelry and Beauty
and Bedding. They were
illuminated
by
gas
camping
lamps
that

flickered like tiki torches.
A few guys barely opened
an eye as we passed,
others were out cold. In a
far corner, two kids not
long out of their teens
were manically reciting
the Gettysburg Address.
Now we are engaged in a
great civil war … One man
sprawled out on the rug in
immaculate jean shorts
and white tennis shoes,

like he was on the way to
his kidʼs T-ball game. Rand
stared at him as if he
might know the guy.
Carthage had a bigger
drug epidemic than I ever
knew: The cops had been
here just yesterday, and
already the druggies had
resettled, like determined
flies. As we made our way
through the piles of
humans, an obese woman

shushed up to us on an
electric scooter. Her face
was pimply and wet with
sweat, her teeth catlike.
“You buying or leaving,
because this ainʼt a showand-tell,” she said.
Stucks
shone
a
flashlight on her face.
“Get that fucking thing
off me.” He did.
“Iʼm looking for my
wife,” I began. “Amy

Dunne. Sheʼs been missing
since Thursday.”
“Sheʼll show up. Sheʼll
wake up, drag herself
home.”
“Weʼre not worried
about drugs,” I said.
“Weʼre more concerned
about some of the men
here.
Weʼve
heard
rumors.”
“Itʼs okay, Melanie,” a
voice called. At the edge of

the juniors section, a rangy
man leaned against a
naked mannequin torso,
watching us, a sideways
grin on his face.
Melanie
shrugged,
bored,
annoyed,
and
motored away.
The man kept his eyes
on us but called toward
the back of the juniors
section, where four sets of
feet poked out from the

dressing
rooms,
men
camped out in their
individual cubicles.
“Hey, Lonnie! Hey, all!
The assholes are back. Five
of ʼem,” the man said. He
kicked an empty beer can
toward us. Behind him,
three sets of feet began
moving,
men
pulling
themselves up. One set
remained still, their owner
asleep or passed out.

“Yeah, fuckos, weʼre
back,” Mikey Hillsam said.
He held his bat like a pool
cue and punched the
mannequin torso between
the breasts. She tottered
toward the ground, the
Blue Book guy removing
his arm gracefully as she
fell, as if it were all part of
a rehearsed act. “We want
some information on a
missing girl.”

The three men from the
dressing rooms joined their
friends. They all wore
Greek-party T-shirts: Pi Phi
Tie-Dye and Fiji Island.
Local
Goodwills
got
inundated with these come
summer—university
graduates shedding their
old souvenirs.
The men were all wirystrong, muscular arms
rivered with popping blue

veins. Behind them, a guy
with a long, drooping
mustache and hair in a
ponytail—Lonnie—came
out of the largest corner
dressing room, dragging a
long length of pipe,
wearing a Gamma Phi Tshirt. We were looking at
mall security.
“Whatʼs up?” Lonnie
called.
We cannot dedicate, we

cannot
consecrate,
we
cannot
hallow
this
ground … the kids were
reciting in a pitch that was
close to screaming.
“Weʼre looking for Amy
Dunne, you probably seen
her on the news, missing
since
Thursday,”
Joe
Hillsam said. “Nice, pretty,
sweet lady, stolen from her
own home.”
“I heard about it. So?”

said Lonnie.
“Sheʼs my wife,” I said.
“We know what you
guysʼve been getting into
out here,” Joe continued,
addressing only Lonnie,
who was tossing his
ponytail
behind
him,
squaring his jaw. Faded
green tattoos covered his
fingers. “We know about
the gang rape.”
I glanced at Rand to

see if he was all right; he
was staring at the naked
mannequin on the floor.
“Gang rape,” Lonnie
said, jerking his head back.
“The fuck you talking
about a gang rape.”
“You guys,” Joe said.
“You Blue Book Boys—”
“Blue Book Boys, like
weʼre some kind of crew.”
Lonnie sniffed. “Weʼre not
animals, asshole. We donʼt

steal women. People want
to feel okay for not helping
us. See, they donʼt deserve
it, theyʼre a bunch of rapists.
Well, bullshit. Iʼd get the
fuck out of this town if the
plant would give me my
back pay. But I got
nothing. None of us got
nothing. So here we are.”
“Weʼll give you money,
good money, if you can
tell us anything about

Amyʼs disappearance,” I
said. “You guys know a lot
of people, maybe you
heard something.”
I pulled out her photo.
The Hillsams and Stucks
looked surprised, and I
realized—of course—this
was
only
a
macho
diversion for them. I
pushed the photo in
Lonnieʼs face, expecting
him to barely glance.

Instead, he leaned in
closer.
“Oh, shit,” he said.
“Her?”
“You recognize her?”
He actually looked
stricken. “She wanted to
buy a gun.”

AMY ELLIOTT
DUNNE
OCTOBER 16,
2010

DIARY ENTRY

Happy anniversary to
me! One full month as a
Missouri resident, and I am

on my way to becoming a
good midwesterner. Yep, I
have gone cold turkey off
all things East Coast and I
have earned my thirty-day
chip (here it would be a
potato chip). I am taking
notes, I am honoring
traditions. I am the
Margaret Mead of the
goddamn Mississip.
Letʼs see, whatʼs new?
Nick and I are currently

embroiled in what I have
taken to calling (to myself)
the
Cuckoo
Clock
Conundrum. My parentsʼ
cherished heirloom looks
ridiculous in the new
house. But then all our
New York stuff does. Our
dignified elephant of a
chesterfield
with
its
matching baby ottoman
sits in the living room
looking stunned, as if it

got sleep-darted in its
natural environment and
woke up in this strange
new captivity, surrounded
by faux-posh carpet and
synthetic
wood
and
unveined walls. I do miss
our old place—all the
bumps and ridges and
hairline fractures left by
the decades. (Pause for
attitude adjustment.) But
new is nice too! Just

different. The clock would
disagree. The cuckoo is
also having a tough time
adjusting to its new space:
The little bird lurches out
drunkenly at ten minutes
after the hour; seventeen
minutes before; forty-one
past. It emits a dying wail
—coo-crrrrww—that every
time
brings
Bleecker
trotting in from some
hideaway, eyes wild, all

business, his tail a bottlebrush as he tilts his head
toward the feathers and
mewls.
“Wow, your parents
must really hate me,” Nick
says whenever weʼre both
in earshot of the noise,
though heʼs smart enough
not to recommend ridding
ourselves of the thing just
yet. I actually want to
trash it too. I am the one

(the jobless) at home all
day, just waiting for its
squawk, a tense moviegoer
steeling myself for the next
outburst from the crazy
patron behind me—both
relieved (there it is!) and
angry (there it is!) each
time it comes.
Much to-do was made
over the clock at the
housewarming (oh, look at
that, an antique clock!),

which Mama Maureen
Dunne
insisted
on.
Actually, not insisted on;
Mama Mo does not insist.
She simply makes things a
reality by assuming they
are such: From the first
morning after the move,
when she appeared on our
doorstep with a welcomehome egg scramble and a
family pack of toilet paper
(which didnʼt speak well

for the egg scramble),
sheʼd spoken of the
housewarming as if it were
a fact. So when do you want
to do your housewarming?
Have you thought about who
I should invite to the
housewarming? Do you want
a
housewarming
or
something fun, like a stockthe-bar party? But a
traditional housewarming is
always nice.

And then suddenly
there was a date, and the
date was today, and Dunne
family and friends were
shaking off the October
drizzle from umbrellas and
carefully, conscientiously
wiping their feet on the
floor mat Maureen had
brought
for
us
this
morning. The rug says: All
Are Friends Who Enter Here.
It is from Costco. I have

learned
about
bulk
shopping in my four weeks
as a Mississippi River
resident. Republicans go to
Samʼs Club, Democrats go
to Costco. But everyone
buys bulk because—unlike
Manhattanites—they
all
have
space
to
store
twenty-four jars of sweet
pickles.
And—unlike
Manhattanites—they
all
have uses for twenty-four

jars of sweet pickles. (No
gathering
is
complete
without a lazy Susan full
of pickles and Spanish
olives right from the jar.
And a salt lick.)
I set the scene: It is one
of those big-smelling days,
when people bring the
outdoors in with them, the
scent of rain on their
sleeves, in their hair. The
older women—Maureenʼs

friends—present varying
food items in plastic,
dishwasher-safe containers
they will later ask to be
returned. And ask and ask.
I know, now, that I am
supposed to wash out the
containers and drop each
of them back by their
proper homes—a Ziploc
carpool—but when I first
came here, I was unaware
of the protocol. I dutifully

recycled all the plastic
containers, and so I had to
go buy all new ones.
Maureenʼs best friend,
Vicky,
immediately
noticed her container was
brand-new, store-bought,
an imposter, and when I
explained my confusion,
she widened her eyes in
amazement: So thatʼs how
they do it in New York.
But the housewarming:

The older women are
Maureenʼs friends from
long-ago PTA meetings,
from book clubs, from the
Shoe-Be-Doo-Be at the
mall, where she spent forty
hours a week slipping
sensible block heels onto
women of a certain age.
(She can size a foot on
sight—womenʼs 8, narrow!
—itʼs her go-to party
trick.) All Moʼs friends

love Nick, and they all
have stories about sweet
things Nick has done for
them over the years.
The younger women,
the women representing
the pool of possible Amyfriends, all sport the same
bleached-blond
wedge
haircut, the same slip-on
mules. They are the
daughters of Maureenʼs
friends, and they all love

Nick, and they all have
stories about sweet things
Nick has done for them
over the years. Most of
them are out of work from
the mall closings, or their
husbands are out of work
from the mall closings, so
they all offer me recipes
for “cheap and easy eats”
that usually involve a
casserole
made
from
canned soup, butter, and a

snack chip.
The men are nice and
quiet and hunker in
circles,
talking
about
sports
and
smiling
benevolently toward me.
Everyone is nice. They
are literally as nice as they
can be. Maureen, the
tristateʼs hardiest cancer
patient, introduces me to
all her friends the same
way youʼd show off a

slightly dangerous new
pet: “This is Nickʼs wife,
Amy, who was born and
raised in New York City.”
And her friends, plump
and
welcoming,
immediately suffer some
strange
Tourettesian
episode: They repeat the
words—New York City!—
with clasped hands and
say something that defies
response: That must have

been neat. Or, in reedy
voices, they sing “New
York, New York,” rocking
side to side with tiny jazz
hands. Maureenʼs friend
from the shoe store, Barb,
drawls “Nue York Ceety!
Get a rope,” and when I
squint at her in confusion,
she says, “Oh, itʼs from
that old salsa commercial!”
and when I still fail to
connect, she blushes, puts

a hand on my arm, and
says, “I wouldnʼt really
hang you.”
Ultimately,
everyone
trails off into giggles and
confesses theyʼve never
been to New York. Or that
theyʼve been—once—and
didnʼt care for it much.
Then I say something like:
Youʼd like it or Itʼs definitely
not for everyone or Mmm,
because Iʼve run out of

things to say.
“Be friendly, Amy,”
Nick spits into my ear
when weʼre refilling drinks
in
the
kitchen
(midwesterners love two
liters of soda, always two
liters, and you pour them
into big red plastic Solo
cups, always).
“I am,” I whine. It
really hurts my feelings,
because if you asked

anyone in that room
whether Iʼd been friendly,
I know theyʼd say yes.
Sometimes I feel like
Nick has decided on a
version of me that doesnʼt
exist. Since weʼve moved
here, Iʼve done girlsʼ
nights out and charity
walks,
Iʼve
cooked
casseroles for his dad and
helped sell tickets for
raffles. I tapped the last of

my money to give to Nick
and Go so they could buy
the bar theyʼve always
wanted, and I even put the
check inside a card shaped
like a mug of beer—Cheers
to You!—and Nick just
gave a flat begrudging
thanks. I donʼt know what
to do. Iʼm trying.
We deliver the soda
pops, me smiling and
laughing even harder, a

vision of grace and good
cheer, asking everyone if I
can get them anything
else,
complimenting
women on ambrosia salads
and crab dips and pickle
slices wrapped in cream
cheese wrapped in salami.
Nickʼs dad arrives with
Go. They stand silently on
the doorstep, Midwest
Gothic, Bill Dunne wiry
and still handsome, a tiny

Band-Aid on his forehead,
Go grim-faced, her hair in
barrettes, her eyes averted
from her father.
“Nick,” Bill Dunne says,
shaking his hand, and he
steps inside, frowning at
me. Go follows, grabs
Nick, and pulls him back
behind
the
door,
whispering, “I have no
idea where he is right
now, headwise. Like if heʼs

having a bad day or if heʼs
just being a jackass. No
idea.”
“Okay, okay. Donʼt
worry, Iʼll keep an eye on
him.”
Go shrugs pissily.
“Iʼm serious, Go. Grab
a beer and take a break.
You are relieved of Dad
duty for the next hour.”
I think: If that had been
me, heʼd complain that I was

being too sensitive.
The older women keep
swirling around me, telling
me how Maureen has
always
said
what
a
wonderful couple Nick and
I are and she is right, we
are clearly made for each
other.
I prefer these wellmeant clichés to the talk
we heard before we got
married.
Marriage
is

compromise and hard work,
and then more hard work
and communication and
compromise. And then work.
Abandon all hope, ye who
enter.
The engagement party
back in New York was the
worst for this, all the
guests hot with wine and
resentment, as if every set
of spouses had gotten into
an argument on the way to

the
club.
Or
they
remembered
some
argument.
Like
Binks.
Binks Moriarty, my momʼs
best friendʼs eighty-eightyear-old mother, stopped
me at the bar—bellowed,
“Amy! I must talk to you!”
in an emergency-room
voice. She twisted her
precious
rings
on
overknuckled
fingers—
twist, turn, creak—and

fondled my arm (that oldperson grope—cold fingers
coveting your nice, soft,
warm, new skin), and then
Binks told me how her late
husband of sixty-three
years had trouble “keeping
it in his pants.” Binks said
this with one of those Iʼm
almost dead, I can say this
kind of stuff grins and
cataract-clouded eyes. “He
just couldnʼt keep it in his

pants,” the old lady said
urgently, her hand chilling
my arm in a death grip.
“But he loved me more
than any of them. I know
it, and you know it.” The
moral to the story being:
Mr. Binks was a cheating
dickweasel, but, you know,
marriage is compromise.
I retreated quickly and
began circulating through
the crowd, smiling at a

series of wrinkled faces,
that baggy, exhausted,
disappointed look that
people get in middle age,
and all the faces were like
that. Most of them were
also drunk, dancing steps
from their youth—swaying
to country-club funk—and
that seemed even worse. I
was making my way to the
French windows for some
air, and a hand squeezed

my arm. Nickʼs mom,
Mama Maureen, with her
big black laser eyes, her
eager
pug-dog
face.
Thrusting a wad of goat
cheese and crackers into
her
mouth,
Maureen
managed to say: “Itʼs not
easy, pairing yourself off
with someone forever. Itʼs
an admirable thing, and
Iʼm glad youʼre both doing
it, but, boy-oh-girl-oh,

there will be days you
wish youʼd never done it.
And those will be the good
times, when itʼs only days
of regret and not months.” I
must have looked shocked
—I was definitely shocked
—because
she
said
quickly: “But then you
have good times too. I
know you will. You two. A
lot of good times. So
just
…
forgive
me,

sweetheart, what I said
before. Iʼm just being a
silly old divorced lady. Oh,
mother of pearl, I think I
had too much wine.” And
she fluttered a goodbye at
me and scampered away
through all the other
disappointed couples.
“Youʼre not supposed
to be here,” Bill Dunne was
suddenly saying, and he
was saying it to me. “Why

are you here? Youʼre not
allowed here.”
“Iʼm Amy,” I say,
touching his arm as if that
might wake him. Bill has
always liked me; even if he
could think of nothing to
say to me, I could tell he
liked me, the way he
watched me like I was a
rare bird. Now he is
scowling, thrusting his
chest
toward
me,
a

caricature of a young
sailor ready to brawl. A
few feet away, Go sets
down her food and gets
ready to move toward us,
quietly, like she is trying
to catch a fly.
“Why are you in our
house?” Bill Dunne says,
his
mouth
grimacing.
“Youʼve got some nerve,
lady.”
“Nick?” Go calls behind

her,
not
loudly
but
urgently.
“Got it,” Nick says,
appearing. “Hey, Dad, this
is
my
wife,
Amy.
Remember
Amy?
We
moved back home so we
could see you more. This is
our new house.”
Nick glares at me: I was
the one who insisted we
invite his dad.
“All Iʼm saying, Nick,”

Bill Dunne says, pointing
now, jabbing an index
finger toward my face, the
party
going
hushed,
several
men
moving
slowly, cautiously, in from
the other room, their
hands twitching, ready to
move, “is she doesnʼt
belong here. Little bitch
thinks she can do whatever
she wants.”
Mama Mo swoops in

then, her arm around her
ex-husband,
always,
always rising to the
occasion. “Of course she
belongs here, Bill. Itʼs her
house. Sheʼs your sonʼs
wife. Remember?”
“I want her out of here,
do you understand me,
Maureen?” He shrugs her
off and starts moving
toward me again. “Dumb
bitch. Dumb bitch.”

Itʼs unclear if he means
me or Maureen, but then
he looks at me and
tightens his lips. “She
doesnʼt belong here.”
“Iʼll go,” I say, and turn
away, walk straight out
the door, into the rain.
From
the
mouths
of
Alzheimerʼs
patients,
I
think, trying to make light.
I walk a loop around the
neighborhood, waiting for

Nick to appear, to guide
me back to our house. The
rain spackles me gently,
dampening me. I really
believe Nick will come
after me. I turn toward the
house and see only a
closed door.

NICK DUNNE
FOUR DAYS
GONE

Rand and I sat in the
vacant Find Amy Dunne
headquarters at five in the
morning, drinking coffee
while we waited for the
cops to check out Lonnie.

Amy stared at us from her
poster perch on the wall.
Her
photo
looked
distressed.
“I just donʼt understand
why she wouldnʼt say
something to you if she
was afraid,” Rand said.
“Why wouldnʼt she tell
you?”
Amy had come to the
mall to buy a gun on
Valentineʼs Day, of all

days, thatʼs what our
friend Lonnie had said. She
was a little abashed, a
little nervous: Maybe Iʼm
being silly, but … I just
really think I need a gun.
Mostly, though, she was
scared.
Someone
was
unnerving her, she told
Lonnie. She gave no more
details, but when he asked
her what kind of gun she
wanted, she said: One that

stops someone fast. He told
her to come back in a few
days, and she did. He
hadnʼt been able to get her
one (“Itʼs not really my
bag, man”), but now he
wished
he
had.
He
remembered her well; over
the
months,
heʼd
wondered how she was
now and then, this sweet
blonde with the fearful
face, trying to get a gun on

Valentineʼs Day.
“Who would she be
afraid of?” Rand asked.
“Tell me about Desi
again, Rand,” I said. “Did
you ever meet him?”
“He came to the house
a
few
times.”
Rand
frowned,
remembering.
“He was a nice-looking
kid, very solicitous of Amy
—treated her like a
princess. But I just never

liked him. Even when
things were good with
them—young love, Amyʼs
first love—even then I
disliked him. He was very
rude to me, inexplicably
so. Very possessive of
Amy, arms around her at
all times. I found it
strange, very strange, that
he wouldnʼt try to be nice
to us. Most young men
want to get in good with

the parents.”
“I wanted to.”
“And you did!” He
smiled. “You were just the
right amount of nervous, it
was very sweet. Desi
wasnʼt
anything
but
nasty.”
“Desiʼs less than an
hour out of town.”
“True.
And
Hilary
Handy?”
Rand
said,
rubbing his eyes. “I donʼt

want to be sexist here—
she was scarier than Desi.
Because that Lonnie guy at
the mall, he didnʼt say
Amy was afraid of a man.”
“No, he just said she
was afraid,” I said. “There
is that Noelle Hawthorne
girl—the one who lives
near us. She told the police
she was best friends with
Amy when I know she
wasnʼt. They werenʼt even

friends. Her husband says
sheʼs been in hysterics.
That she was looking at
pictures of Amy, crying. At
the time I thought they
were
Internet
photos,
but … what if they were
actual photos she had of
Amy? What if she was
stalking Amy?”
“She tried to talk with
me when I was a little
busy yesterday,” Rand

said. “She quoted some
Amazing Amy stuff at me.
Amazing Amy and the Best
Friend War, actually. ʻBest
friends are the people who
know us best.ʼ ”
“Sounds like Hilary,” I
said. “All grown up.”
We met Boney and
Gilpin just after seven
A.M. at an IHOP out along
the
highway
for
a
showdown:
It
was

ridiculous that we were
doing their job for them. It
was insane that we were
the ones discovering leads.
It was time to call in the
FBI if the local cops
couldnʼt handle it.
A plump, amber-eyed
waitress took our orders,
poured us coffee, and,
clearly recognizing me,
lingered
within
eavesdropping
distance

until Gilpin scatted her
away. She was like a
determined
housefly,
though. Between drink
refills and dispensing of
utensils and the magically
quick arrival of our food,
our entire harangue came
in limp bursts. This is
unacceptable … no more
coffee, thanks … itʼs
unbelievable that … uh,
sure, rye is fine …

Before we were done,
Boney
interrupted.
“I
understand,
guys,
itʼs
natural to want to feel
involved. But what you did
was dangerous. You have
got to let us handle this
kind of thing.”
“Thatʼs just it, though,
you arenʼt handling it,” I
said. “Youʼd never have
gotten this information,
about the gun, if we didnʼt

go out there last night.
What did Lonnie say when
you talked to him?”
“Same thing you said
he said,” Gilpin said. “Amy
wanted to buy a gun, she
was scared.”
“You donʼt seem that
impressed
by
this
information,” I snapped.
“Do you think he was
lying?”
“We donʼt think he was

lying,”
Boney
said.
“Thereʼs no reason for the
guy to invite police
attention to himself. He
seemed very struck by
your wife. Very … I donʼt
know, rattled that this had
happened to her. He
remembered
specific
details. Nick, he said she
was wearing a green scarf
that day. You know, not a
winter scarf but a fashion-

statement scarf.” She made
fluttery moves with her
fingers to show she
thought fashion to be
childish, unworthy of her
attention. “Emerald green.
Ring a bell?”
I nodded. “She has one
she wears with blue jeans
a lot.”
“And a pin on her
jacket—a gold cursive A?”
“Yes.”

Boney shrugged: Well,
that settles it.
“You donʼt think he
might have been so struck
by
her
that
he … kidnapped her?” I
asked.
“He has an alibi. Rocksolid,” Boney said, giving
me a pointed look. “To tell
the truth, weʼve begun to
look for … a different kind
of motive.”

“Something
more … personal,” Gilpin
added.
He
looked
dubiously at his pancakes,
topped with strawberries
and puffs of whipped
cream. He began scraping
them to the side of his
plate.
“More personal,” I said.
“So does that mean youʼre
finally going to talk to Desi
Collings, or Hilary Handy?

Or do I need to?” I had, in
fact, promised Marybeth
Iʼd go today.
“Sure, we will,” Boney
said. She had the placating
tone of a girl promising
her pesky mom to eat
better. “We doubt itʼs a
lead—but weʼll talk to
them.”
“Well, great, thanks for
doing your job, kind of,” I
said. “And what about

Noelle Hawthorne? If you
want someone close to
home, sheʼs right in our
complex, and she seems a
little obsessed with Amy.”
“I know, sheʼs called
us, and sheʼs on our list.”
Gilpin nodded. “Today.”
“Good. What else are
you doing?”
“Nick, weʼd actually
like you to make some
time for us, let us pick

your brain a bit more,”
Boney said. “Spouses often
know more than they
realize. Weʼd like you to
think a bit more about the
argument—that
barnburner your neighbor
Mrs.,
uh,
Teverer
overheard you and Amy
having the night before
she went missing.”
Randʼs head jerked
toward me.

Jan
Teverer,
the
Christian casserole lady
who wouldnʼt meet my
eye anymore.
“I mean, could it have
been because—I know this
is hard to hear, Mr. Elliott
—because Amy was under
the
influence
of
something?” Boney asked.
Innocent eyes. “I mean,
maybe she has had contact
with less savory elements

in town. There are plenty
of other drug dealers.
Maybe she got in over her
head, and thatʼs why she
wanted a gun. Thereʼs got
to be a reason she wants a
gun for protection and
doesnʼt tell her husband.
And Nick, weʼd like you to
think harder about where
you were between that
time—the time of the
argument, about eleven

P.M., the last anyone
heard Amyʼs voice—”
“Besides me.”
“Besides
you—and
noon, when you arrived at
your bar. If you were out
and about in this town,
driving to the beach,
hanging around the dock
area, someone must have
seen you. Even if it was
someone just, you know,
walking his dog. If you can

help us, I think that would
be really …”
“Helpful,”
Gilpin
finished. He speared a
strawberry.
They both watched me
attentively,
congenially.
“Itʼd be super-helpful,
Nick,” Gilpin repeated
more pleasantly. First time
Iʼd heard about the
argument—that they knew
about it—and they chose

to tell me in front of Rand
—and they chose to
pretend it wasnʼt a gotcha.
“Sure thing,” I said.
“You mind telling us
what it was about?” Boney
asked. “The argument?”
“What did Mrs. Teverer
tell you it was about?”
“I hate to take her word
when I got you right here.”
She poured some cream
into her coffee.

“It was such a nothing
argument,”
I
began.
“Thatʼs why I never
mentioned it. Just both of
us scrapping at each other,
the way couples do
sometimes.”
Rand looked at me as if
he had no clue what I was
talking about: Scrapping?
What is this scrapping of
which you speak?
“It was just—about

dinner,” I lied. “About
what weʼd do for dinner
for our anniversary. You
know,
Amy
is
a
traditionalist about these
things—”
“The lobster!” Rand
interrupted. He turned to
the cops. “Amy cooks
lobster every year for
Nick.”
“Right. But thereʼs
nowhere to get lobster in

this town, not alive, from
the tank, so she was
frustrated. I had the
Houstonʼs reservation—”
“I thought you said you
didnʼt have a Houstonʼs
reservation.”
Rand
frowned.
“Well, yes, sorry, Iʼm
getting confused. I just had
the idea of the Houstonʼs
reservation. But I really
should have just arranged

to have some lobster flown
in.”
The cops, each of them,
raised
an
accidental
eyebrow. How very fancy.
“Itʼs not that expensive
to do. Anyway, we were at
this rotten loggerheads,
and it was one of those
arguments that got bigger
than it should have.” I
took a bite of my
pancakes. I could feel the

heat rushing from under
my collar. “We were
laughing about it within
the hour.”
“Hunh” was all Boney
said.
“And where are you on
the treasure hunt?” Gilpin
asked.
I stood up, put down
some money, ready to go. I
wasnʼt the one who was
supposed to be playing

defense here. “Nowhere,
not right yet—itʼs hard to
think clearly with so much
going on.”
“Okay,” Gilpin said.
“Itʼs less likely the treasure
hunt is an angle, now that
we know she was already
feeling threatened months
ago. But keep me in the
loop anyway, okay?”
We all shuffled out into
the heat. As Rand and I got

into our car, Boney called
out, “Hey, is Amy still a
two, Nick?”
I frowned at her.
“A size two?” she
repeated.
“Yes, she is, I think,” I
said. “Yes. She is.”
Boney made a face that
said Hmmmm, and got in
her car.
“What do you think
that was about?” Rand

asked.
“Those
two,
who
knows?”
We remained silent for
most of the way to the
hotel, Rand staring out the
window at the rows of
fast-food
restaurants
blinking by, me thinking
about my lie—my lies. We
had to circle to find a
space at the Days Inn; the
payroll convention was

apparently a hot ticket.
“You know, itʼs funny,
how provincial I am,
lifetime
New
Yorker,”
Rand said, fingers on the
door handle. “When Amy
talked about moving back
here, back along the Ole
Mississippi River, with
you, I pictured … green,
farmland, apple trees, and
those great old red barns. I
have to tell you, itʼs really

quite ugly here.” He
laughed. “I canʼt think of a
single thing of beauty in
this whole town. Except
for my daughter.”
He got out and strode
quickly toward the hotel,
and I didnʼt try to catch
up.
I
entered
the
headquarters
a
few
minutes behind him, took
a seat at a secluded table
toward the back of the

room.
I
needed
to
complete the treasure hunt
before
the
clues
disappeared, figure out
where Amy had been
taking me. After a few
hoursʼ stint here, Iʼd deal
with the third clue. In the
meantime, I dialed.
“Yeah,”
came
an
impatient voice. A baby
was
crying
in
the
background. I could hear

the woman blow the hair
off her face.
“Hi, is this—is this
Hilary Handy?”
She hung up. I phoned
back.
“Hello?”
“Hi there. I think we
got cut off before.”
“Would you put this
number on your do not call
list—”
“Hilary, Iʼm not selling

anything, Iʼm calling about
Amy Dunne—Amy Elliott.”
Silence.
The
baby
squawked again, a mewl
that wavered dangerously
between
laughter
and
tantrum.
“What about her?”
“I donʼt know if youʼve
seen this on TV, but sheʼs
gone missing. She went
missing on July fifth under
potentially
violent

circumstances.”
“Oh. Iʼm sorry.”
“Iʼm Nick Dunne, her
husband. Iʼve just been
calling old friends of hers.”
“Oh yeah?”
“I wondered if youʼd
had any contact with her.
Recently.”
She breathed into the
phone, three deep breaths.
“Is this because of that,
that bullshit back in high

school?” Farther in the
background,
a
childʼs
wheedling voice yelled
out, “Moo-oom, I nee-eed
you.”
“In a minute, Jack,” she
called into the void behind
her. Then returned to me
with a bright red voice: “Is
it? Is that why youʼre
calling me? Because that
was twenty goddamn years
ago. More.”

“I know. I know. Look,
I have to ask. Iʼd be an
asshole not to ask.”
“Jesus fucking Christ.
Iʼm a mother of three kids
now. I havenʼt talked to
Amy since high school. I
learned my lesson. If I saw
her on the street, Iʼd run
the other way.” The baby
howled. “I gotta go.”
“Just real quick, Hilary
—”

She hung up, and
immediately,
my
disposable
vibrated.
I
ignored it. I had to find a
place to stow the damn
thing.
I
could
feel
the
presence of someone, a
woman, near me, but I
didnʼt look up, hoping she
would go away.
“Itʼs not even noon,
and you already look like

youʼve had a full day, poor
baby.”
Shawna Kelly. She had
her hair pulled up in a
high
bubblegum-girl
ponytail.
She
aimed
glossed lips at me in a
sympathetic pout. “You
ready for some of my Frito
pie?” She was bearing a
casserole dish, holding it
just below her breasts, the
saran wrap dappled with

sweat. She said the words
like she was the star of
some ʼ80s hair-rock video:
You want summa my pie?
“Big breakfast. Thanks,
though. Thatʼs really kind
of you.”
Instead of going away,
she sat down. Under a
turquoise tennis skirt, her
legs were lotioned so well
they reflected. She kicked
me with the toe of an

unblemished Tretorn. “You
sleeping, sweetie?”
“Iʼm holding up.”
“Youʼve got to sleep,
Nick. Youʼre no good to
anyone
if
youʼre
exhausted.”
“I might leave in a little
bit, see if I can grab a few
hours.”
“I think you should. I
really do.”
I felt a sudden keen

gratitude to her. It was my
mamaʼs-boy
attitude,
rising
up.
Dangerous.
Crush it, Nick.
I waited for her to go.
She needed to go—people
were beginning to watch
us.
“If you want, I can
drive you home right
now,” she said. “A nap
might be just the thing for
you.”

She reached out to
touch my knee, and I felt a
burst of rage that she
didnʼt realize she needed
to go. Leave the casserole,
you clingy groupie whore,
and
go.
Daddyʼs-boy
attitude, rising up. Just as
bad.
“Why donʼt you check
in with Marybeth?” I said
brusquely, and pointed to
my mother-in-law by the

Xerox, making endless
copies of Amyʼs photo.
“Okay.” She lingered,
so I began ignoring her
outright. “Iʼll leave you to
it, then. Hope you like the
pie.”
The
dismissal
had
stung her, I could tell,
because she made no eye
contact as she left, just
turned and sauntered off. I
felt
bad,
debated

apologizing, making nice.
Do not go after that woman,
I ordered myself.
“Any news?” It was
Noelle
Hawthorne,
entering the same space
Shawna had just vacated.
She was younger than
Shawna but seemed older
—a plump body with dour,
wide-spaced mounds for
breasts. A frown on her
face.

“Not so far.”
“You sure seem to be
handling it all okay.”
I twitched my head at
her, unsure what to say.
“Do you even know
who I am?” she asked.
“Of
course.
Youʼre
Noelle Hawthorne.”
“Iʼm Amyʼs best friend
here.”
I had to remind the
police: There were only

two options with Noelle.
She was either a lying
publicity whore—she liked
the cachet of being pals
with a missing woman—or
she was crazy. A stalker
determined to befriend
Amy, and when Amy
shirked her …
“Do you have any
information about Amy,
Noelle?” I asked.
“Of course I do, Nick.

She was my best friend.”
We stared each other
down for a few seconds.
“Are you going to share
it?” I asked.
“The
police
know
where to find me. If they
ever get around to it.”
“Thatʼs super-helpful,
Noelle. Iʼll make sure they
talk to you.”
Her cheeks blazed red,
two expressionist splatters

of color.
She went away. I
thought
the
unkind
thought, one of those that
burbled up beyond my
control. I thought: Women
are fucking crazy. No
qualifier: Not some women,
not many women. Women
are crazy.
Once night fell fully, I
drove to my dadʼs vacant
house, Amyʼs clue on the

seat beside me.
Maybe you feel
guilty for bringing me
here
I must admit it
felt a bit queer
But itʼs not like
we had the choice of
many a place
We made the
decision: We made this
our space.
Letʼs take our

love to this little brown
house
Gimme some
goodwill, you hot lovinʼ
spouse!
This one was more
cryptic than the others, but
I was sure I had it right.
Amy
was
conceding
Carthage, finally forgiving
me for moving back here.
Maybe you feel guilty for
bringing me here … [but]

We made this our space.
The little brown house was
my fatherʼs house, which
was actually blue, but Amy
was making another inside
joke. Iʼd always liked our
inside jokes the best—they
made me feel more
connected to Amy than
any
amount
of
confessional truth-telling
or passionate lovemaking
or talk-till-sunrising. The

“little brown house” story
was about my father, and
Amy is the only person Iʼd
ever told it to: that after
the divorce, I saw him so
seldom that I decided to
think of him as a character
in a storybook. He was not
my actual father—who
would have loved me and
spent time with me—but a
benevolent and vaguely
important figure named

Mr. Brown, who was very
busy doing very important
things for the United
States and who (very)
occasionally used me as a
cover to move more easily
about town. Amy got tears
in her eyes when I told her
this, which I hadnʼt meant,
Iʼd meant it as a kids are
funny story. She told me
she was my family now,
that she loved me enough

to make up for ten crappy
fathers, and that we were
now the Dunnes, the two
of us. And then she
whispered in my ear, “I do
have an assignment you
might be good for …”
As for bringing back
the goodwill, that was
another conciliation. After
my father was completely
lost to the Alzheimerʼs, we
decided to sell his place, so

Amy and I went through
his house, putting together
boxes for Goodwill. Amy,
of course, was a whirling
dervish of doing—pack,
store, toss—while I sifted
through my fatherʼs things
glacially.
For
me,
everything was a clue. A
mug with deeper coffee
stains than the others must
be his favorite. Was it a
gift? Who gave it to him?

Or did he buy it himself? I
pictured my father finding
the very act of shopping
emasculating. Still, an
inspection of his closet
revealed five pairs of
shoes, shiny new, still in
their boxes. Had he bought
these himself, picturing a
different, more social Bill
Dunne than the one slowly
unspooling alone? Did he
go to Shoe-Be-Doo-Be, get

my mother to help him,
just another in a long line
of her casual kindnesses?
Of course, I didnʼt share
any of these musings with
Amy, so Iʼm sure I came
off as the goldbricker I so
often am.
“Here. A box. For
Goodwill,”
she
said,
catching me on the floor,
leaning against a wall,
staring at a shoe. “You put

the shoes in the box.
Okay?” I was embarrassed,
I snarled at her, she
snapped at me, and … the
usual.
I should add, in Amyʼs
defense, that sheʼd asked
me twice if I wanted to
talk, if I was sure I wanted
to do this. I sometimes
leave out details like that.
Itʼs more convenient for
me. In truth, I wanted her

to read my mind so I
didnʼt have to stoop to the
womanly
art
of
articulation.
I
was
sometimes as guilty of
playing the figure-me-out
game as Amy was. Iʼve left
that bit of information out
too.
Iʼm a big fan of the lie
of omission.
I pulled up in front of
my dadʼs house just after

ten P.M. It was a tidy little
place, a good starter home
(or ender home). Two
bedrooms,
two
baths,
dining room, dated but
decent kitchen. A for-sale
sign rusted in the front
yard. One year and not a
bite.
I entered the stuffy
house, the heat rolling
over me. The budget alarm
system we installed after

the third break-in began
beeping, like a bomb
countdown. I input the
code, the one that drove
Amy insane because it
went against every rule
about codes. It was my
birthday: 81577.
Code rejected. I tried
again. Code rejected. A
bead of sweat rolled down
my back. Amy had always
threatened to change the

code. She said it was
pointless to have one that
was so guessable, but I
knew the real reason. She
resented that it was my
birthday and not our
anniversary: Once again
Iʼd chosen me over us. My
semi-sweet nostalgia for
Amy
disappeared.
I
stabbed my finger at the
numbers again, growing
more panicked as the

alarm beeped and beeped
and beeped its countdown
—until it went into full
intruder blare.
Woooonk-woooonkwoooonk!
My cell phone was
supposed to ring so I could
give the all-clear: Just me,
the idiot. But it didnʼt. I
waited a full minute, the
alarm reminding me of a
torpedoed-submarine

movie. The canned heat of
a closed house in July
shimmered over me. My
shirt back was already
soaked. Goddammit, Amy. I
scanned the alarm for the
companyʼs number and
found nothing. I pulled
over a chair and began
yanking at the alarm; I had
it off the wall, hanging by
the cords, when my phone
finally rang. A bitchy voice

on
the
other
end
demanded Amyʼs first petʼs
name.
Woooonk-woooonkwoooonk!
It was exactly the
wrong
tone—smug,
petulant,
utterly
unconcerned—and exactly
the
wrong
question,
because I didnʼt know the
answer, which infuriated
me. No matter how many

clues I solved, Iʼd be faced
with some Amy trivia to
unman me.
“Look, this is Nick
Dunne, this is my dadʼs
house, this account was set
up by me,” I snapped. “So
it doesnʼt really fucking
matter what my wifeʼs first
petʼs name was.”
Woooonk-woooonkwoooonk!
“Please donʼt take that

tone with me, sir.”
“Look, I just came in to
grab one thing from my
dadʼs house, and now Iʼm
leaving, okay?”
“I have to notify the
police immediately.”
“Can you just turn off
the goddamn alarm so I
can think?”
Woooonk-woooonkwoooonk!
“The alarmʼs off.”

“The alarm is not off.”
“Sir, I warned you
once, do not take that tone
with me.”
You fucking bitch.
“You know what? Fuck
it, fuck it, fuck it.”
I hung up just as I
remembered Amyʼs catʼs
name, the very first one:
Stuart.
I called back, got a
different
operator,
a

reasonable operator, who
turned off the alarm and,
God bless her, called off
the police. I really wasnʼt
in the mood to explain
myself.
I sat on the thin, cheap
carpet and made myself
breathe,
my
heart
clattering. After a minute,
after
my
shoulders
untensed and my jaw
unclenched and my hands

unfisted and my heart
returned to normal, I stood
up
and
momentarily
debated just leaving, as if
that would teach Amy a
lesson. But as I stood up, I
saw a blue envelope left on
the kitchen counter like a
Dear John note.
I took a deep breath,
blew it out—new attitude
—and
opened
the
envelope, pulled out the

letter marked with a heart.
Hi Darling,
So we both have
things we want to
work on. For me,
itʼd
be
my
perfectionism, my
occasional (wishful
thinking?)
selfrighteousness. For
you? I know you
worry that youʼre
sometimes
too

distant,
too
removed, unable to
be
tender
or
nurturing. Well, I
want to tell you—
here in your fatherʼs
house—that
isnʼt
true. You are not
your father. You
need to know that
you are a good man,
you are a sweet
man, you are kind.

Iʼve punished you
for not being able to
read
my
mind
sometimes, for not
being able to act in
exactly the way I
wanted you to act
right at exactly that
moment. I punished
you for being a real,
breathing man. I
ordered you around
instead of trusting

you to find your
way. I didnʼt give
you the benefit of
the doubt: that no
matter how much
you and I blunder,
you always love me
and want me to be
happy. And that
should be enough
for any girl, right? I
worry Iʼve said
things about you

that arenʼt actually
true,
and
that
youʼve come to
believe them. So I
am here to say now:
You are WARM.
You are my sun.
If Amy were with me,
as sheʼd planned on being,
she would have nuzzled
into me the way she used
to do, her face in the crook
of my neck, and she would

have kissed me and smiled
and said, You are, you
know. My sun. My throat
tight, I took a final look
around my fatherʼs house
and left, closing the door
on the heat. In my car, I
fumbled open the envelope
marked fourth clue. We
had to be near the end.
Picture me: Iʼm a
girl who is very bad
I need to be

punished,
and
by
punished, I mean had
Itʼs where you
store
goodies
for
anniversary five
Pardon me if this
is getting contrived!
A good time was
had here right at sunny
midday
Then out for a
cocktail, all so terribly
gay.

So run there right
now, full of sweet sighs,
And open the
door for your big
surprise.
My stomach seized. I
didnʼt know what this one
meant. I reread it. I
couldnʼt even guess. Amy
had stopped taking it easy
on me. I wasnʼt going to
finish the treasure hunt
after all.

I felt a surge of angst.
What a fucking day. Boney
was out to get me, Noelle
was insane, Shawna was
pissed,
Hilary
was
resentful, the woman at
the security company was
a bitch, and my wife had
stumped me finally. It was
time to end this goddamn
day. There was only one
woman I could stand to be
around right now.

Go took one look at me
—rattled, tight-lipped, and
heat-exhausted from my
dadʼs—and parked me on
the couch, announced
sheʼd make some late
dinner. Five minutes later,
she was stepping carefully
toward me, balancing my
meal on an ancient TV
tray. An old Dunne
standby: grilled cheese and
BBQ chips, a plastic cup

of …
“Itʼs not Kool-Aid,” Go
said. “Itʼs beer. Kool-Aid
seemed
a
little
too
regressive.”
“This is very nurturing
and strange of you, Go.”
“Youʼre
cooking
tomorrow.”
“Hope you like canned
soup.”
She sat down on the
couch next to me, stole a

chip from my plate, and
asked, too casually: “Any
thoughts on why the cops
would ask me if Amy was
still a size two?”
“Jesus,
they
wonʼt
fucking let that go,” I said.
“Doesnʼt it freak you
out? Like, they found her
clothes or something?”
“Theyʼd have asked me
to identify them. Right?”
She thought about that

a second, her face pinched.
“That makes sense,” she
said. Her face remained
pinched until she caught
me looking, then she
smiled. “I taped the ball
game, wanna watch? You
okay?”
“Iʼm okay.” I felt awful,
my stomach greasy, my
psyche crackling. Maybe it
was the clue I couldnʼt
figure out, but I suddenly

felt like Iʼd overlooked
something. Iʼd made some
huge mistake, and my
error would be disastrous.
Maybe
it
was
my
conscience,
scratching
back to the surface from
its secret oubliette.
Go pulled up the game
and, for the next ten
minutes, remarked on the
game only, and only
between sips of her beer.

Go didnʼt like grilled
cheese; she was scooping
peanut butter out of the jar
onto saltines. When a
commercial break came
on, she paused and said,
“If I had a dick, I would
fuck this peanut butter,”
deliberately
spraying
cracker bits toward me.
“I think if you had a
dick, all sorts of bad things
would happen.”

She
fast-forwarded
through a nothing inning,
Cards trailing by five.
When it was time for the
next commercial break, Go
paused, said, “So I called
to change my cell-phone
plan today, and the hold
song was Lionel Ritchie—
do you ever listen to
Lionel Ritchie? I like
ʻPenny Lover,ʼ but the
song wasnʼt ʻPenny Lover,ʼ

but anyway, then a woman
came on the line, and she
said the customer-service
reps are all based in Baton
Rouge, which was strange
because she didnʼt have an
accent, but she said she
grew up in New Orleans,
and itʼs a little-known fact
that—what do you call
someone
from
New
Orleans,
a
New
Orleansean?—anyway,

that they donʼt have much
of an accent. So she said
for my package, package
A …”
Go and I had a game
inspired by our mom, who
had a habit of telling such
outrageously
mundane,
endless stories that Go was
positive she had to be
secretly fucking with us.
For about ten years now,
whenever Go and I hit a

conversation lull, one of us
would break in with a
story
about
appliance
repair
or
coupon
fulfillment. Go had more
stamina than I did, though.
Her stories could drone on,
seamlessly, forever—they
went on so long that they
became
genuinely
annoying and then swung
back around to hilarious.
Go was moving on to a

story
about
her
refrigerator
light
and
showed
no
signs
of
faltering. Filled with a
sudden,
heavy
gratefulness,
I
leaned
across the couch and
kissed her on the cheek.
“Whatʼs that for?”
“Just, thanks.” I felt my
eyes get full with tears. I
looked away for a second
to blink them off, and Go

said, “So I needed a tripleA battery, which, as it
turns out, is different from
a transistor battery, so I
had to find the receipt to
return
the
transistor
battery …”
We finished watching
the game. Cards lost.
When it was over, Go
switched the TV to mute.
“You want to talk, or you
want more distraction?

Whatever you need.”
“You go on to bed, Go.
Iʼm just going to flip
around. Probably sleep. I
need to sleep.”
“You
want
an
Ambien?” My twin was a
staunch believer in the
easiest way. No relaxation
tapes or whale noises for
her; pop a pill, get
unconscious.
“Nah.”

“Theyʼre
in
the
medicine cabinet if you
change your mind. If there
was ever a time for
assisted sleep …” She
hovered over me for just a
few seconds, then, Go-like,
trotted down the hall,
clearly not sleepy, and
closed her door, knowing
the kindest thing was to
leave me alone.
A lot of people lacked

that gift: knowing when to
fuck off. People love
talking, and I have never
been a huge talker. I carry
on an inner monologue,
but the words often donʼt
reach my lips. She looks
nice today, Iʼd think, but
somehow
it
wouldnʼt
occur to me to say it out
loud. My mom talked, my
sister talked. Iʼd been
raised to listen. So, sitting

on the couch by myself,
not talking, felt decadent. I
leafed through one of Goʼs
magazines, flipped through
TV
channels,
finally
alighting on an old blackand-white show, men in
fedoras scribbling notes
while a pretty housewife
explained
that
her
husband was away in
Fresno, which made the
two cops look at each

other significantly and
nod. I thought of Gilpin
and
Boney
and
my
stomach lurched.
In my pocket, my
disposable
cell
phone
made a mini-jackpot sound
that meant I had a text:
im outside open

AMY
ELLIOTT
DUNNE
APRIL 28, 2011

DIARY ENTRY

Just got to keep on
keeping on, thatʼs what
Mama Mo says, and when

she says it—her sureness,
each word emphasized, as
if it really were a viable
life strategy—the cliché
stops being a set of words
and turns into something
real. Valuable. Keep on
keeping on, exactly! I think.
I do love that about the
Midwest: People donʼt
make a big deal about
everything.
Not
even
death. Mama Mo will just

keep on keeping on until
the cancer shuts her down,
and then she will die.
So Iʼm keeping my head
down and making the best of
a bad situation, and I mean
that in the deep, literal
Mama Mo usage. I keep
my head down and do my
work: I drive Mo to
doctorʼs appointments and
chemo appointments. I
change the sickly water in

the flower vase in Nickʼs
fatherʼs room, and I drop
off cookies for the staff so
they take good care of
him.
Iʼm making the best of
a really bad situation, and
the situation is mostly bad
because my husband, who
brought me here, who
uprooted me to be closer
to his ailing parents, seems
to have lost all interest in

both me and said ailing
parents.
Nick has written off his
father entirely: He wonʼt
even say the manʼs name. I
know every time we get a
phone call from Comfort
Hill, Nick is hoping itʼs the
announcement that his dad
is dead. As for Mo, Nick
sat with his mom during a
single chemo session and
pronounced it unbearable.

He said he hated hospitals,
he hated sick people, he
hated the slowly ticking
time, the IV bag dripping
molasses-slow. He just
couldnʼt do it. And when I
tried to talk him back into
it, when I tried to stiffen
his spine with some gotta
do what you gotta do, he
told me to do it. So I did, I
have. Mama Mo, of course,
takes on the burden of his

blame. We sat one day,
partly watching a romantic
comedy on my computer
but mostly chatting, while
the
IV
dripped … so … slowly,
and as the spunky heroine
tripped over a sofa, Mo
turned to me and said,
“Donʼt be too hard on
Nick. About not wanting to
do this kind of thing. I just
always doted on him, I

babied him—how could
you not? That face. And so
he has trouble doing hard
things. But I truly donʼt
mind, Amy. Truly.”
“You should mind,” I
said.
“Nick doesnʼt have to
prove his love for me,” she
said, patting my hand. “I
know he loves me.”
I
admire
Moʼs
unconditional love, I do.

So I donʼt tell her what I
have found on Nickʼs
computer,
the
book
proposal for a memoir
about
a
Manhattan
magazine
writer
who
returns to his Missouri
roots to care for both his
ailing parents. Nick has all
sorts of bizarre things on
his
computer,
and
sometimes I canʼt resist a
little light snooping—it

gives me a clue as to what
my husband is thinking.
His search history gave me
the latest: noir films and
the website of his old
magazine and a study on
the
Mississippi
River,
whether itʼs possible to
free-float from here to the
Gulf. I know what he
pictures: floating down the
Mississippi,
like
Huck
Finn, and writing an

article about it. Nick is
always looking for angles.
I was nosing through
all this when I found the
book proposal.
Double Lives: A Memoir
of Ends and Beginnings will
especially resonate with
Gen X males, the original
man-boys, who are just
beginning to experience
the stress and pressures
involved with caring for

aging parents. In Double
Lives, I will detail:
• My
growing
understanding of
a troubled, oncedistant father
• My
painful,
forced
transformation
from a carefree
young man into
the head of a

family as I deal
with
the
imminent death
of a much loved
mother
• The
resentment
my
Manhattanite
wife feels at this
detour in her
previously
charmed life. My
wife, it should be

mentioned,
is
Amy
Elliott
Dunne,
the
inspiration for the
best-selling
Amazing
Amy
series.
The proposal was never
completed,
I
assume
because Nick realized he
wasnʼt going to ever
understand
his
oncedistant father; and because

Nick was shirking all
“head of the family”
duties; and because I
wasnʼt expressing any
anger about my new life. A
little frustration, yes, but
no book-worthy rage. For
so
many
years,
my
husband has lauded the
emotional
solidity
of
midwesterners:
stoic,
humble,
without
affectation!
But
these

arenʼt the kinds of people
who provide good memoir
material.
Imagine
the
jacket copy: People behaved
mostly well and then they
died.
Still, it stings a bit, “the
resentment
my
Manhattanite wife feels.”
Maybe
I
do
feel … stubborn. I think of
how consistently lovely
Maureen is, and I worry

that Nick and I were not
meant to be matched. That
he would be happier with
a woman who thrills at
husband
care
and
homemaking, and Iʼm not
disparaging these skills: I
wish I had them. I wish I
cared more that Nick
always has his favorite
toothpaste, that I know his
collar size off the top of
my head, that I am an

unconditionally
loving
woman whose greatest
happiness is making my
man happy.
I was that way, for a
while, with Nick. But it
was unsustainable. Iʼm not
selfless
enough.
Only
child, as Nick points out
regularly.
But I try. I keep on
keeping on, and Nick runs
around town like a kid

again. Heʼs happy to be
back in his rightful promking place—he dropped
about ten pounds, he got a
new haircut, he bought
new jeans, he looks
freakinʼ great. But I only
know that from the
glimpses of him coming
home or going back out,
always in a pretend hurry.
You wouldnʼt like it, his
standard response anytime

I ask to come with him,
wherever it is he goes. Just
like he jettisoned his
parents when they were of
no use to him, heʼs
dropping me because I
donʼt fit in his new life.
Heʼd have to work to make
me comfortable here, and
he doesnʼt want to do that.
He wants to enjoy himself.
Stop it, stop it. I must
look on the bright side.

Literally. I must take my
husband out of my dark
shadowy thoughts and
shine some cheerful golden
light on him. I must do
better at adoring him like I
used to. Nick responds to
adoration. I just wish it felt
more equal. My brain is so
busy with Nick thoughts,
itʼs a swarm inside my
head: Nicknicknicknicknick!
And when I picture his

mind, I hear my name as a
shy crystal ping that
occurs once, maybe twice,
a
day
and
quickly
subsides. I just wish he
thought about me as much
as I do him.
Is that wrong? I donʼt
even know anymore.

NICK DUNNE
FOUR DAYS
GONE

She was standing there
in the orange glow of the
streetlight, in a flimsy
sundress, her hair wavy
from the humidity. Andie.
She rushed through the

doorway, her arms splayed
to hug me, and I hissed,
“Wait, wait!” and shut the
door just before she
wrapped herself around
me. She pressed her cheek
against my chest, and I put
my hand on her bare back
and closed my eyes. I felt a
queasy mixture of relief
and horror: when you
finally stop an itch and
realize itʼs because youʼve

ripped a hole in your skin.
I have a mistress. Now
is the part where I have to
tell you I have a mistress
and you stop liking me. If
you liked me to begin
with. I have a pretty,
young,
very
young
mistress, and her name is
Andie.
I know. Itʼs bad.
“Baby, why the fuck
havenʼt you called me?”

she said, her face still
pressed against me.
“I know, sweetheart, I
know. You just canʼt
imagine. Itʼs been a
nightmare. How did you
find me?”
She held on to me.
“Your house was dark, so I
figured try Goʼs.”
Andie knew my habits,
knew my habitats. Weʼve
been together a while. I

have a pretty, very young
mistress, and weʼve been
together a while.
“I was worried about
you, Nick. Frantic. Iʼm
sitting at Madiʼs house,
and the TV is, like, just on,
and all of a sudden on the
TV, I see this, like, guy
who looks like you talking
about his missing wife.
And then I realize: It is
you. Can you imagine how

freaked out I was? And
you didnʼt even try to
reach me?”
“I called you.”
“Donʼt say anything, sit
tight, donʼt say anything till
we talk. Thatʼs an order,
thatʼs not you trying to
reach me.”
“I havenʼt been alone
much; people have been
around me all the time.
Amyʼs parents, Go, the

police.” I breathed into her
hair.
“Amyʼs just gone?” she
asked.
“Sheʼs just gone.” I
pulled myself from her and
sat down on the couch,
and she sat beside me, her
leg pressed against mine,
her arm brushing against
mine. “Someone took her.”
“Nick? Are you okay?”
Her chocolatey hair fell

in waves over her chin,
collarbone, breasts, and I
watched one single strand
shake in the stream of her
breathing.
“No, not really.” I gave
her the shhh sign and
pointed
toward
the
hallway. “My sister.”
We sat side by side,
silent, the TV flickering
the old cop show, the men
in fedoras making an

arrest. I felt her hand
wriggle into mine. She
leaned in to me as if we
were settling in for a
movie night, some lazy,
carefree couple, and then
she pulled my face toward
her and kissed me.
“Andie,
no,”
I
whispered.
“Yes, I need you.” She
kissed me again and
climbed onto my lap,

where she straddled me,
her cotton dress slipping
up around her knees, one
of her flip-flops falling to
the floor. “Nick, Iʼve been
so worried about you. I
need to feel your hands on
me, thatʼs all Iʼve been
thinking
about.
Iʼm
scared.”
Andie was a physical
girl, and thatʼs not code
for Itʼs all about the sex.

She was a hugger, a
toucher, she was prone to
running
her
fingers
through my hair or down
my back in a friendly
scratch.
She
got
reassurance and comfort
from touching. And yes,
fine, she also liked sex.
With one quick tug, she
yanked down the top of
her sundress and moved
my hands onto her breasts.

My
canine-loyal
lust
surfaced.
I want to fuck you, I
almost said aloud. You are
WARM, my wife said in
my ear. I lurched away. I
was so tired, the room was
swimming.
“Nick?” Her bottom lip
was wet with my spit.
“What? Are we not okay?
Is it because of Amy?”
Andie had always felt

young—she was twentythree, of course she felt
young—but right then I
realized how grotesquely
young she was, how
irresponsibly, disastrously
young she was. Ruinously
young. Hearing my wifeʼs
name on her lips always
jarred me. She said it a lot.
She liked to discuss Amy,
as if Amy were the heroine
on a nighttime soap opera.

Andie never made Amy
the enemy; she made her a
character.
She
asked
questions, all the time,
about our life together,
about Amy: What did you
guys do, together in New
York, like what did you do
on the weekends? Andieʼs
mouth went O once when I
told her about going to the
opera. You went to the
opera? What did she wear?

Full-length? And a wrap or a
fur? And her jewelry and
her hair? Also: What were
Amyʼs friends like? What
did we talk about? What
was Amy like, like, really
like? Was she like the girl
in the books, perfect? It
was
Andieʼs
favorite
bedtime story: Amy.
“My sister is in the
other room, sweetheart.
You shouldnʼt even be

here. God, I want you
here, but you really
shouldnʼt
have
come,
babe. Until we know what
weʼre dealing with.”
YOU ARE BRILLIANT
YOU ARE WITTY YOU ARE
WARM. Now kiss me!
Andie remained atop
me, her breasts out,
nipples going hard from
the air-conditioning.
“Baby,
what
weʼre

dealing with right now is I
need to make sure weʼre
okay. Thatʼs all I need.”
She pressed against me,
warm and lush. “Thatʼs all
I need. Please, Nick, Iʼm
freaked out. I know you: I
know you donʼt want to
talk right now, and thatʼs
fine. But I need you … to
be with me.”
And I wanted to kiss
her then, the way I had

that very first time: our
teeth bumping, her face
tilted to mine, her hair
tickling my arms, a wet
and tonguey kiss, me
thinking of nothing but the
kiss, because it would be
dangerous to think of
anything but how good it
felt. The only thing that
kept me from dragging her
into the bedroom now was
not how wrong it was—it

had been many shades of
wrong all along—but that
now it was actually
dangerous.
And because there was
Amy. Finally, there was
Amy, that voice that had
made its home in my ear
for half a decade, my
wifeʼs voice, but now it
wasnʼt chiding, it was
sweet again. I hated that
three little notes from my

wife could make me feel
this way, soggy and
sentimental.
I had absolutely no
right to be sentimental.
Andie was burrowing
into me, and I was
wondering if the police
had Goʼs house under
surveillance, if I should be
listening for a knock at the
door. I have a very young,
very pretty mistress.

My mother had always
told her kids: If youʼre
about to do something,
and you want to know if
itʼs a bad idea, imagine
seeing it printed in the
paper for all the world to
see.
Nick Dunne, a onetime
magazine writer still pridewounded from a 2010
layoff, agreed to teach a
journalism class for North

Carthage Junior College. The
older married man promptly
exploited his position by
launching a torrid fuckfest
of an affair with one of his
impressionable
young
students.
I was the embodiment
of every writerʼs worst
fear: a cliché.
Now let me string still
more clichés together for
your
amusement:
It

happened gradually. I
never meant to hurt
anyone. I got in deeper
than I thought I would.
But it was more than a
fling. It was more than an
ego boost. I really love
Andie. I do.
The
class
I
was
teaching—“How to Launch
a
Magazine
Career”—
contained
fourteen
students
of
varying

degrees of skill. All girls.
Iʼd say women, but I think
girls is factually correct.
They all wanted to work in
magazines. They werenʼt
smudgy newsprint girls,
they were glossies. Theyʼd
seen the movie: They
pictured
themselves
dashing
around
Manhattan, latte in one
hand, cell phone in the
other, adorably breaking a

designer heel while hailing
a cab, and falling into the
arms of a charming,
disarming soul mate with
winningly floppy hair.
They had no clue about
how foolish, how ignorant,
their choice of a major
was. Iʼd been planning on
telling them as much,
using my layoff as a
cautionary tale. Although I
had no interest in being

the tragic figure. I pictured
delivering
the
story
nonchalantly, jokingly—no
big deal. More time to
work on my novel.
Then I spent the first
class answering so many
awestruck questions, and I
turned
into
such
a
preening gasbag, such a
needy fuck, that I couldnʼt
bear to tell the real story:
the call into the managing

editorʼs office on the
second round of layoffs,
the hiking of that doomed
path down the long rows
of cubicles, all eyes
shifting toward me, dead
man walking, me still
hoping I was going to be
told something different—
that the magazine needed
me now more than ever
—yes! it would be a buckup speech, an all-hands-

on-deck speech! But no,
my boss just said: I guess
you know, unfortunately,
why I called you in here,
rubbing his eyes under his
glasses, to show how
weary and dejected he
was.
I wanted to feel like a
shiny-cool winner, so I
didnʼt tell my students
about my demise. I told
them we had a family

illness that required my
attention here, which was
true, yes, I told myself,
entirely true, and very
heroic.
And
pretty,
freckled Andie sat a few
feet in front of me, wideset blue eyes under
chocolatey waves of hair,
cushiony lips parted just a
bit, ridiculously large, real
breasts, and long thin legs
and arms—an alien fuck-

doll of a girl, it must be
said, as different from my
elegant, patrician wife as
could be—and Andie was
radiating body heat and
lavender, clicking notes on
her
laptop,
asking
questions in a husky voice
like “How do you get a
source to trust you, to
open up to you?” And I
thought to myself, right
then: Where the fuck did

this girl come from? Is this a
joke?
You ask yourself, Why?
Iʼd been faithful to Amy
always. I was the guy who
left the bar early if a
woman was getting too
flirty, if her touch was
feeling too nice. I was not
a cheater. I donʼt (didnʼt?)
like cheaters: dishonest,
disrespectful,
petty,
spoiled. I had never

succumbed. But that was
back when I was happy. I
hate to think the answer is
that easy, but I had been
happy all my life, and now
I was not, and Andie was
there, lingering after class,
asking me questions about
myself that Amy never
had, not lately. Making me
feel like a worthwhile
man, not the idiot who lost
his job, the dope who

forgot to put the toilet seat
down, the blunderer who
just could never quite get
it right, whatever it was.
Andie brought me an
apple one day. A Red
Delicious (title of the
memoir of our affair, if I
were to write one). She
asked me to give her story
an early look. It was a
profile of a stripper at a St.
Louis club, and it read like

a Penthouse Forum piece,
and Andie began eating
my apple while I read it,
leaning over my shoulder,
the
juice
sitting
ludicrously on her lip, and
then I thought, Holy shit,
this girl is trying to seduce
me, foolishly shocked, an
aging Benjamin Braddock.
It worked. I began
thinking of Andie as an
escape, an opportunity. An

option. Iʼd come home to
find Amy in a tight ball on
the sofa, Amy staring at
the wall, silent, never
saying the first word to
me, always waiting, a
perpetual
game
of
icebreaking, a constant
mental
challenge—what
will make Amy happy
today? I would think:
Andie wouldnʼt do that. As
if I knew Andie. Andie

would laugh at that joke,
Andie would like that story.
Andie was a nice, pretty,
bosomy Irish girl from my
hometown,
unassuming
and jolly. Andie sat in the
front row of my class, and
she looked soft, and she
looked interested.
When I thought about
Andie, my stomach didnʼt
hurt the way it did with
my wife—the constant

dread of returning to my
own home, where I wasnʼt
welcome.
I began imagining how
it might happen. I began
craving her touch—yes, it
was like that, just like a
lyric from a bad ʼ80s
single—I craved her touch,
I craved touch in general,
because my wife avoided
mine: At home she slipped
past me like a fish, sliding

just out of grazing distance
in the kitchen or the
stairwell. We watched TV
silently on our two sofa
cushions, as separate as if
they were life rafts. In bed,
she turned away from me,
pushed blankets and sheets
between us. I once woke
up in the night and,
knowing she was asleep,
pulled aside her halter
strap a bit, and pressed my

cheek and a palm against
her bare shoulder. I
couldnʼt get back to sleep
that night, I was so
disgusted with myself. I
got out of bed and
masturbated
in
the
shower, picturing Amy, the
lusty way she used to look
at me, those heavy-lidded
moonrise eyes taking me
in, making me feel seen.
When I was done, I sat

down in the bathtub and
stared at the drain through
the spray. My penis lay
pathetically along my left
thigh, like some small
animal washed ashore. I
sat at the bottom of the
bathtub, humiliated, trying
not to cry.
So it happened. In a
strange, sudden snowstorm
in early April. Not April of
this year, April of last year.

I was working the bar
alone because Go was
having a Mom Night; we
took turns not working,
staying home with our
mother and watching bad
TV. Our mom was going
fast, she wouldnʼt last the
year, not even close.
I was actually feeling
okay right at that moment
—my mom and Go were
snuggled up at home

watching
an
Annette
Funicello beach movie,
and The Bar had had a
busy, lively night, one of
those
nights
where
everyone seemed to have
come off a good day.
Pretty girls were nice to
homely guys. People were
buying
rounds
for
strangers just because. It
was festive. And then it
was the end of the night,

time to close, everybody
out. I was about to lock
the door when Andie flung
it wide and stepped in,
almost on top of me, and I
could smell the light-beer
sweetness on her breath,
the scent of woodsmoke in
her hair. I paused for that
jarring moment when you
try to process someone
youʼve seen in only one
setting, put them in a new

context. Andie in The Bar.
Okay. She laughed a
pirate-wench laugh and
pushed me back inside.
“I just had the most
fantastically awful date,
and you have to have a
drink
with
me.”
Snowflakes gathered in the
dark waves of her hair, her
sweet scattering of freckles
glowed, her cheeks were
bright pink, as if someone

had double-slapped her.
She has this great voice,
this fuzzy-duckling voice,
that starts out ridiculously
cute
and
ends
up
completely sexy. “Please,
Nick, Iʼve got to get that
bad-date taste out of my
mouth.”
I
remember
us
laughing, and thinking
what a relief it was to be
with a woman and hear

her
laugh.
She
was
wearing jeans and a
cashmere V-neck; she is
one of those girls who look
better in jeans than a
dress. Her face, her body,
is casual in the best way. I
assumed
my
position
behind the bar, and she
slid onto a bar stool, her
eyes assessing all the
liquor bottles behind me.
“Whaddya want, lady?”

“Surprise me,” she said.
“Boo,” I said, the word
leaving my lips kisspuckered.
“Now surprise me with
a drink.” She leaned
forward so her cleavage
was leveraged against the
bar, her breasts pushed
upward. She wore a
pendant on a thin gold
chain; the pendant slid
between her breasts down

under her sweater. Donʼt
be that guy, I thought. The
guy who pants over where
the pendant ends.
“What flavor you feel
like?” I asked.
“Whatever you give
me, Iʼll like.”
It was that line that
caught me, the simplicity
of it. The idea that I could
do something and it would
make a woman happy, and

it would be easy. Whatever
you give me, Iʼll like. I felt
an overwhelming wave of
relief. And then I knew I
didnʼt love Amy anymore.
I donʼt love my wife
anymore,
I
thought,
turning to grab two
tumblers. Not even a little
bit. I am wiped clean of love,
I am spotless. I made my
favorite drink: Christmas
Morning, hot coffee and

cold peppermint schnapps.
I had one with her, and
when she shivered and
laughed—that big whoop
of a laugh—I poured us
another round. We drank
together an hour past
closing
time,
and
I
mentioned the word wife
three times, because I was
looking at Andie and
picturing
taking
her
clothes off. A warning for

her, the least I could do: I
have a wife. Do with that
what you will.
She sat in front of me,
her chin in her hands,
smiling up at me.
“Walk me home?” she
said. Sheʼd mentioned
before how close she lived
to downtown, how she
needed to stop by The Bar
some night and say hello,
and did she mention how

close she lived to The Bar?
My mind had been primed:
Many times Iʼd mentally
strolled the few blocks
toward the bland brick
apartments where she
lived. So when I suddenly
was out the door, walking
her home, it didnʼt seem
unusual
at
all—there
wasnʼt that warning bell
that told me: This is
unusual, this is not what we

do.

I walked her home,
against the wind, snow
flying everywhere, helping
her rewrap her red knitted
scarf once, twice, and on
the third time, I was
tucking her in properly
and our faces were close,
and her cheeks were a
merry
holiday-sledding
pink, and it was the kind
of thing that could never

have happened in another
hundred nights, but that
night it was possible. The
conversation, the booze,
the storm, the scarf.
We grabbed each other
at the same time, me
pushing her up against a
tree for better leverage,
the
spindly
branches
dumping a pile of snow on
us, a stunning, comical
moment that only made

me more insistent on
touching her, touching
everything at once, one
hand
up
inside
her
sweater, the other between
her legs. And her letting
me.
She pulled back from
me, her teeth chattering.
“Come up with me.”
I paused.
“Come up with me,”
she said again. “I want to

be with you.”
The sex wasnʼt that
great, not the first time.
We were two bodies used
to different rhythms, never
quite getting the hang of
each other, and it had
been so long since Iʼd been
inside a woman, I came
first, quickly, and kept
moving, thirty crucial
seconds as I began wilting
inside her, just long

enough to get her taken
care of before I went
entirely slack.
So it was nice but
disappointing,
anticlimactic, the way girls
must feel when they give
up their virginity: That was
what all the fuss was about?
But I liked how she
wrapped herself around
me, and I liked that she
was as soft as Iʼd

imagined.
New
skin.
Young,
I
thought
disgracefully,
picturing
Amy and her constant
lotioning, sitting in bed
and slapping away at
herself angrily.
I went into Andieʼs
bathroom, took a piss,
looked at myself in the
mirror, and made myself
say it: You are a cheater.
You have failed one of the

most basic male tests. You
are not a good man. And
when that didnʼt bother
me, I thought: Youʼre
really not a good man.
The horrifying thing
was, if the sex had been
outrageously
mindblowing, that might have
been my sole indiscretion.
But it was only decent, and
now I was a cheater, and I
couldnʼt ruin my record of

fidelity
on
something
merely average. So I knew
there would be a next. I
didnʼt promise myself
never again. And then the
next was very, very good,
and the next after that was
great. Soon Andie became
a physical counterpoint to
all things Amy. She
laughed with me and made
me laugh, she didnʼt
immediately contradict me

or second-guess me. She
never scowled at me. She
was easy. It was all so
fucking easy. And I
thought: Love makes you
want to be a better man—
right, right. But maybe love,
real love, also gives you
permission to just be the
man you are.
I was going to tell Amy.
I knew it had to happen. I
continued not to tell Amy,

for months and months.
And then more months.
Most of it was cowardice. I
couldnʼt bear to have the
conversation, to have to
explain myself. I couldnʼt
imagine having to discuss
the divorce with Rand and
Marybeth,
as
they
certainly would insert
themselves into the fray.
But part of it, in truth, was
my strong streak of

pragmatism—it was almost
grotesque, how practical
(self-serving?) I could be. I
hadnʼt asked Amy for a
divorce, in part, because
Amyʼs money had financed
The Bar. She basically
owned it, she would
certainly take it back. And
I couldnʼt bear to look at
my twin trying to be brave
as she lost another couple
years of her life. So I let

myself drift on in the
miserable
situation,
assuming that at some
point Amy would take
charge,
Amy
would
demand a divorce, and
then I would get to be the
good guy.
This desire—to escape
the
situation
without
blame—was
despicable.
The more despicable I
became, the more I craved

Andie, who knew that I
wasnʼt as bad as I seemed,
if my story were published
in the paper for strangers
to read. Amy will divorce
you, I kept thinking. She
canʼt let it linger on much
longer. But as spring faded
away and summer came,
then fall, then winter, and
I became a cheating man
of all seasons—a cheat
with
a
pleasantly

impatient
mistress—it
became
clear
that
something would have to
be done.
“I mean, I love you,
Nick,” Andie said, here,
surreally, on my sisterʼs
sofa. “No matter what
happens. I donʼt really
know what else to say, I
feel pretty …” She threw
her hands up. “Stupid.”
“Donʼt feel stupid,” I

said. “I donʼt know what to
say either. Thereʼs nothing
to say.”
“You can say that you
love me no matter what
happens.”
I thought: I canʼt say
that out loud anymore. Iʼd
said it once or twice, a
spitty mumble against her
neck,
homesick
for
something. But the words
were out there, and so was

a lot more. I thought then
of the trail weʼd left, our
busy, semi-hidden love
affair that I hadnʼt worried
enough about. If her
building had a security
camera, I was on it. Iʼd
bought a disposable phone
just for her calls, but those
voice mails and texts went
to her very permanent cell.
Iʼd written her a dirty
valentine that I could

already see splashed across
the news, me rhyming
besot with twat. And more:
Andie was twenty-three. I
assumed my words, my
voice, even photos of me
were captured on various
electronica. Iʼd flipped
through the photos on her
phone one night, jealous,
possessive, curious, and
seen plenty of shots of an
ex or two smiling proudly

in her bed, and I assumed
at one point Iʼd join the
club—I kind of wanted to
join the club—and for
some reason that hadnʼt
worried me, even though it
could be downloaded and
sent to a million people in
the space of a vengeful
second.
“This is an extremely
weird situation, Andie. I
just need you to be

patient.”
She pulled back from
me. “You canʼt say you
love me, no matter what
happens?”
“I love you, Andie. I
do.” I held her eyes. Saying
I love you was dangerous
right now, but so was not
saying it.
“Fuck me, then,” she
whispered.
She
began
tugging at my belt.

“We have to be real
careful right now. I … Itʼs
a bad, bad place for me if
the police find out about
us. It looks beyond bad.”
“Thatʼs what youʼre
worried about?”
“Iʼm a man with a
missing
wife
and
a
secret … girlfriend. Yeah,
it looks bad. It looks
criminal.”
“That makes it sound

sleazy.” Her breasts were
still out.
“People donʼt know us,
Andie. They will think itʼs
sleazy.”
“God, itʼs like some bad
noir movie.”
I smiled. Iʼd introduced
Andie to noir—to Bogart
and The Big Sleep, Double
Indemnity, all the classics.
It was one of the things I
liked best about us, that I

could show her things.
“Why donʼt we just tell
the police?” she said.
“Wouldnʼt that be better
—”
“No. Andie, donʼt even
think about it. No.”
“Theyʼre going to find
out—”
“Why? Why would
they? Have you told
anyone
about
us,
sweetheart?”

She gave me a twitchy
look. I felt bad: This was
not how she thought the
night would go. She had
been excited to see me, she
had been imagining a lusty
reunion,
physical
reassurance, and I was
busy covering my ass.
“Sweetheart, Iʼm sorry,
I just need to know,” I
said.
“Not by name.”

“What do you mean,
not by name?”
“I mean,” she said,
pulling up her dress
finally, “my friends, my
mom, they know Iʼm
seeing someone, but not
by name.”
“And not by any kind
of description, right?” I
said it more urgently than
I wanted to, feeling like I
was
holding
up
a

collapsing ceiling. “Two
people know about this,
Andie. You and me. If you
help me, if you love me, it
will just be us knowing,
and then the police will
never find out.”
She traced a finger
along my jawline. “And
what if—if they never find
Amy?”
“You and I, Andie,
weʼll be together no

matter what happens. But
only if weʼre careful. If
weʼre not careful, itʼs
possible— It looks bad
enough that I could go to
prison.”
“Maybe she ran off
with someone,” she said,
leaning her cheek against
my shoulder. “Maybe—”
I could feel her girlbrain buzzing, turning
Amyʼs disappearance into

a
frothy,
scandalous
romance, ignoring any
reality that didnʼt suit the
narrative.
“She didnʼt run off. Itʼs
much more serious than
that.” I put a finger under
her chin so she looked at
me. “Andie? I need you to
take this very seriously,
okay?”
“Of course Iʼm taking it
seriously. But I need to be

able to talk to you more
often. To see you. Iʼm
freaking out, Nick.”
“We just need to sit
tight for now.” I gripped
both her shoulders so she
had to look at me. “My
wife is missing, Andie.”
“But you donʼt even—”
I knew what she was
about to say—you donʼt
even love her—but she was
smart enough to stop.

She put her arms
around me. “Look, I donʼt
want to fight. I know you
care about Amy, and I
know you must be really
worried. I am too. I know
you are under … I canʼt
imagine the pressure. So
Iʼm fine keeping an even
lower profile than I did
before, if thatʼs possible.
But remember, this affects
me too. I need to hear

from you. Once a day. Just
call when you can, even if
itʼs only for a few seconds,
so I can hear your voice.
Once a day, Nick. Every
single day. Iʼll go crazy
otherwise. Iʼll go crazy.”
She smiled at me,
whispered, “Now kiss me.”
I kissed her very softly.
“I love you,” she said,
and I kissed her neck and
mumbled my reply. We sat

in
silence,
the
TV
flickering.
I let my eyes close. Now
kiss me, who had said that?
I lurched awake just
after five A.M. Go was up,
I could hear her down the
hall, running water in the
bathroom. I shook Andie—
Itʼs five A.M., itʼs five A.M.
—and with promises of
love and phone calls, I
hustled her toward the

door like a shameful onenighter.
“Remember, call every
day,” Andie whispered.
I heard the bathroom
door open.
“Every day,” I said, and
ducked behind the door as
I opened it and Andie left.
When I turned back
around, Go was standing
in the living room. Her
mouth had dropped open,

stunned, but the rest of her
body was in full fury:
hands on hips, eyebrows
Vʼed.
“Nick. You fucking
idiot.”

AMY ELLIOTT
DUNNE
JULY 21, 2011

DIARY ENTRY

I am such an idiot.
Sometimes I look at myself
and I think: No wonder
Nick finds me ridiculous,
frivolous, spoiled, compared

to his mom. Maureen is
dying. She hides her
disease behind big smiles
and roomy embroidered
sweatshirts,
answering
every question about her
health with: “Oh, Iʼm just
fine, but how are you
doing, sweetie?” She is
dying, but she is not going
to admit it, not yet. So
yesterday she phones me
in the morning, asks me if

I want to go on a field trip
with her and her friends—
she is having a good day,
she wants to get out of the
house as much as she can
—and I agree immediately,
even though I knew theyʼd
be doing nothing that
particularly interested me:
pinochle, bridge, some
church
activity
that
usually requires sorting
things.

“Weʼll be there in
fifteen minutes,” she says.
“Wear short sleeves.”
Cleaning. It had to be
cleaning.
Something
requiring elbow grease. I
throw on a short-sleeve
shirt, and in exactly fifteen
minutes, I am opening the
door to Maureen, bald
under a knitted cap,
giggling with her two
friends. They are all

wearing
matching
appliquéd T-shirts, all bells
and ribbons, with the
words
The
PlasMamas
airbrushed across their
chests.
I think theyʼve started
a do-wop group. But then
we all climb into Roseʼs
old Chrysler—old-old, one
of those where the front
seat goes all the way
across, a grandmotherly

car that smells of lady
cigarettes—and off we
merrily go to the plasma
donation center.
“Weʼre Mondays and
Thursdays,” Rose explains,
looking at me in the
rearview.
“Oh,” I say. How else
does one reply? Oh, those
are awesome plasma days!
“Youʼre allowed to give
twice a week,” says

Maureen, the bells on her
sweatshirt jingling. “The
first time you get twenty
dollars, the second time
you get thirty. Thatʼs why
everyoneʼs in such a good
mood today.”
“Youʼll love it,” Vicky
says. “Everyone just sits
and chats, like a beauty
salon.”
Maureen squeezes my
arm and says quietly, “I

canʼt give anymore, but I
thought you could be my
proxy. It might be a nice
way for you to get some
pin money—itʼs good for a
girl to have a little cash of
her own.”
I swallow a quick gust
of anger: I used to have
more than a little cash of my
own, but I gave it to your
son.
A scrawny man in an

undersize
jean
jacket
hangs around the parking
lot like a stray dog. Inside,
though, the place is clean.
Well lit, piney-smelling,
with Christian posters on
the wall, all doves and
mist. But I know I canʼt do
it. Needles. Blood. I canʼt
do either. I donʼt really
have any other phobias,
but those two are solid—I
am the girl who swoons at

a paper cut. Something
about the opening of skin:
peeling, slicing, piercing.
During
chemo
with
Maureen, I never looked
when they put in the
needle.
“Hi,
Cayleese!”
Maureen calls out as we
enter, and a heavy black
woman in a vaguely
medical
uniform
calls
back, “Hi there, Maureen!

How you feeling?”
“Oh, Iʼm fine, just fine
—but how are you?”
“How long have you
been doing this?” I ask.
“Awhile,”
Maureen
says.
“Cayleese
is
everyoneʼs favorite, she
gets the needle in real
smooth. Which was always
good for me, because I
have rollers.” She proffers
her forearm with its ropey

blue veins. When I first
met Mo, she was fat, but
no more. Itʼs odd, she
actually looks better fat.
“See, try to put your finger
on one.”
I look around, hoping
Cayleese is going to usher
us in.
“Go on, try.”
I touch a fingertip to
the vein and feel it roll out
from under. A rush of heat

overtakes me.
“So, is this our new
recruit?” Cayleese asks,
suddenly
beside
me.
“Maureen brags on you all
the time. So, weʼll need
you to fill out some
paperwork—”
“Iʼm sorry, I canʼt. I
canʼt do needles, I canʼt do
blood. I have a serious
phobia. I literally canʼt do
it.”

I realize I havenʼt eaten
today, and a wave of
wooziness hits me. My
neck feels weak.
“Everything here is
very hygienic, youʼre in
very
good
hands,”
Cayleese says.
“No, itʼs not that, truly.
Iʼve never given blood. My
doctor gets angry at me
because I canʼt even
handle a yearly blood test

for, like, cholesterol.”
Instead, we wait. It
takes two hours, Vicky and
Rose strapped to churning
machines. Like they are
being harvested. Theyʼve
even been branded on
their fingers, so they canʼt
give more than twice in a
week
anywhere—the
marks show up under a
purple light.
“Thatʼs the James Bond

part,” Vicky says, and they
all giggle. Maureen hums
the Bond theme song (I
think), and Rose makes a
gun with her fingers.
“Canʼt you old biddies
keep it down for once?”
calls
a
white-haired
woman four chairs down.
She leans up over the
reclined bodies of three
oily
men—green-blue
tattoos on their arms,

stubble on their chins, the
kind of men I pictured
donating
plasma—and
gives a finger wave with
her loose arm.
“Mary! I thought you
were coming tomorrow!”
“I
was,
but
my
unemployment
doesnʼt
come for a week, and I
was down to a box of
cereal and a can of
creamed corn!”

They all laugh like
near-starvation is amusing
—this town is sometimes
too much, so desperate
and so in denial. I begin to
feel ill, the sound of blood
churning, the long plastic
ribbons of blood coursing
from bodies to machines,
the people being, what,
being
farmed.
Blood
everywhere I look, out in
the open, where blood

isnʼt supposed to be. Deep
and dark, almost purple.
I get up to go to the
bathroom, throw cold
water on my face. I take
two steps and my ears
close up, my vision
pinholes, I feel my own
heartbeat, my own blood,
and as I fall, I say, “Oh.
Sorry.”
I barely remember the
ride home. Maureen tucks

me into bed, a glass of
apple juice, a bowl of
soup, at the bedside. We
try to call Nick. Go says
heʼs not at The Bar, and he
doesnʼt pick up his cell.
The man disappears.
“He was like that as a
boy too—heʼs a wanderer,”
Maureen
says.
“Worst
thing you could ever do is
ground him to his room.”
She positions a cool

washcloth on my forehead;
her breath has the tangy
smell of aspirin. “Your job
is to rest, okay? Iʼll keep
calling till I get that boy
home.”
When Nick gets home,
Iʼm asleep. I wake up to
hear him taking a shower,
and I check the time:
11:04 P.M. He must have
gone by The Bar after all—
he likes to shower after a

shift, get the beer and salty
popcorn smell off his skin.
(He says.)
He slips into bed, and
when I turn to him with
open eyes, he looks
dismayed Iʼm awake.
“Weʼve been trying to
reach you for hours,” I say.
“My phone was out of
juice. You fainted?”
“I thought you said
your phone was out of

juice.”
He pauses, and I know
he is about to lie. The
worst feeling: when you
just have to wait and
prepare yourself for the
lie. Nick is old-fashioned,
he needs his freedom, he
doesnʼt like to explain
himself. Heʼll know he has
plans with the guys for a
week, and heʼll still wait
until an hour before the

poker game to tell me
nonchalantly, “Hey, so I
thought Iʼd join the guys
for poker tonight, if thatʼs
okay with you,” and leave
me to be the bad guy if
Iʼve made other plans. You
donʼt ever want to be the
wife who keeps her
husband from playing
poker—you donʼt want to
be the shrew with the hair
curlers and the rolling pin.

So you swallow your
disappointment and say
okay. I donʼt think he does
this to be mean, itʼs just
how he was raised. His
dad did his own thing,
always, and his mom put
up with it. Until she
divorced him.
He begins his lie. I
donʼt even listen.

NICK DUNNE
FIVE DAYS GONE

I leaned against the
door, staring at my sister. I
could still smell Andie, and
I wanted that moment to
myself for one second,
because now that she was
gone, I could enjoy the

idea of her. She always
tasted like butterscotch
and smelled like lavender.
Lavender
shampoo,
lavender lotion. Lavenderʼs
for luck, she explained to
me once. Iʼd need luck.
“How old is she?” Go
was demanding, hands on
hips.
“Thatʼs where you want
to start?”
“How old is she, Nick?”

“Twenty-three.”
“Twenty-three.
Brilliant.”
“Go, donʼt—”
“Nick. Do you not
realize how fucked you
are?” Go said. “Fucked and
dumb.” She made dumb—a
kidʼs word—hit me as hard
as if I were a ten-year-old
again.
“Itʼs not an ideal
situation,” I allowed, my

voice quiet.
“Ideal situation! You
are … youʼre a cheater,
Nick.
I
mean,
what
happened to you? You
were always one of the
good guys. Or have I just
been an idiot all along?”
“No.” I stared at the
floor, at the same spot I
stared at as a kid when my
mom sat me down on the
sofa and told me I was

better than whatever Iʼd
just done.
“Now? Youʼre a man
who cheats on his wife, you
canʼt ever undo that,” Go
said. “God, even Dad
didnʼt cheat. Youʼre so—I
mean,
your
wife
is
missing, Amyʼs who knows
where, and youʼre here
making time with a little
—”
“Go, I enjoy this

revisionist history in which
youʼre Amyʼs champion. I
mean, you never liked
Amy, not even early on,
and
since
all
this
happened, itʼs like—”
“Itʼs
like
I
have
sympathy for your missing
wife, yeah, Nick. I have
concern. Yeah, I do.
Remember how before,
when I said you were
being weird? Youʼre—Itʼs

insane, the way youʼre
acting.”
She paced the room,
chewing a thumbnail. “The
police find out about this,
and I just donʼt even
know,” she said. “Iʼm
fucking scared, Nick. This
is the first time Iʼm really
scared for you. I canʼt
believe they havenʼt found
out yet. They must have
pulled
your
phone

records.”
“I used a disposable.”
She paused at that.
“Thatʼs
even
worse.
Thatʼs
…
like
premeditation.”
“Premeditated
cheating, Go. Yes, I am
guilty of that.”
She succumbed for a
second, collapsed on the
sofa, the new reality
settling on her. In truth, I

was relieved that Go knew.
“How long?” she asked.
“A little over a year.” I
made myself pull my eyes
from the floor and look at
her directly.
“Over a year? And you
never told me.”
“I was afraid youʼd tell
me to stop. That youʼd
think badly of me and then
Iʼd have to stop. And I
didnʼt want to. Things

with Amy—”
“Over a year,” Go said.
“And I never even guessed.
Eight
thousand
drunk
conversations, and you
never trusted me enough
to tell me. I didnʼt know
you could do that, keep
something from me that
totally.”
“Thatʼs the only thing.”
Go shrugged: How can I
believe you now? “You love

her?” She gave it a jokey
spin to show how unlikely
it was.
“Yeah. I really think I
do. I did. I do.”
“You do realize, that if
you actually dated her,
saw her on a regular basis,
lived with her, that she
would find some fault with
you, right? That she would
find some things about you
that drove her crazy. That

sheʼd make demands of
you that you wouldnʼt like.
That sheʼd get angry at
you?”
“Iʼm not ten, Go, I
know how relationships
work.”
She shrugged again: Do
you? “We need a lawyer,”
she said. “A good lawyer
with some PR skills,
because the networks,
some cable shows, theyʼre

sniffing around. We need
to make sure the media
doesnʼt turn you into the
evil philandering husband,
because if that happens, I
just think itʼs all over.”
“Go, youʼre sounding a
little drastic.” I actually
agreed with her, but I
couldnʼt bear to hear the
words aloud, from Go. I
had to discredit them.
“Nick, this is a little

drastic. Iʼm going to make
some calls.”
“Whatever you want, if
it makes you feel better.”
Go jabbed me in the
sternum with two hard
fingers. “Donʼt you fucking
pull that with me, Lance.
ʻOh,
girls
get
so
overexcited.ʼ
Thatʼs
bullshit. You are in a really
bad place, my friend. Get
your head out of your ass

and start helping me fix
this.”
Beneath my shirt, I
could
feel
the
spot
embering on my skin as Go
turned away from me and,
thank God, went back to
her room. I sat on her
couch, numb. Then I lay
down as I promised myself
Iʼd get up.
I dreamed of Amy: She
was crawling across our

kitchen floor, hands and
knees, trying to make it to
the back door, but she was
blind from the blood, and
she was moving so slowly,
too slowly. Her pretty
head
was
strangely
misshapen, dented in on
the right side. Blood was
dripping from one long
hank of hair, and she was
moaning my name.
I woke and knew it was

time to go home. I needed
to see the place—the scene
of the crime—I needed to
face it.
No one was out in the
heat. Our neighborhood
was as vacant and lonely
as
the
day
Amy
disappeared. I stepped
inside my front door and
made
myself
breathe.
Weird that a house so new
could feel haunted, and

not in the romantic
Victorian-novel way, just
really gruesomely, shittily
ruined. A house with a
history, and it was only
three years old. The lab
technicians had been all
over the place; surfaces
were smeared and sticky
and smudged. I sat down
on the sofa, and it smelled
like someone, like an
actual person, with a

strangerʼs scent, a spicy
aftershave. I opened the
windows despite the heat,
get in some air. Bleecker
trotted down the stairs,
and I picked him up and
petted him while he
purred. Someone, some
cop, had overfilled his
bowl for me. A nice
gesture, after dismantling
my home. I set him down
carefully on the bottom

step, then climbed up to
the bedroom, unbuttoning
my shirt. I lay down across
the bed and put my face in
the pillow, the same navy
blue pillowcase Iʼd stared
into the morning of our
anniversary, The Morning
Of.
My phone rang. Go. I
picked up.
“Ellen Abbott is doing a
special noon-day show. Itʼs

about Amy. You. I, uh, it
doesnʼt look good. You
want me to come over?”
“No, I can watch it
alone, thanks.”
We both hovered on
the line. Waiting for the
other to apologize.
“Okay, letʼs talk after,”
Go said.
Ellen Abbott Live was a
cable show specializing in
missing, murdered women,

starring the permanently
furious Ellen Abbott, a
former prosecutor and
victimsʼ rights advocate.
The show opened with
Ellen, blow-dried and lipglossed, glaring at the
camera. “A shocking story
to
report
today:
a
beautiful, young woman
who was the inspiration
for the Amazing Amy book
series. Missing. House torn

apart. Hubby is Lance
Nicholas
Dunne,
an
unemployed writer who
now owns a bar he bought
with his wifeʼs money.
Want
to
know
how
worried he is? These are
photos taken since his
wife, Amy Elliott Dunne,
went missing July fifth—
their five-year anniversary.”
Cut to the photo of me
at the press conference,

the jackass grin. Another
of me waving and smiling
like a pageant queen as I
got out of my car (I was
waving back to Marybeth; I
was smiling because I
smile when I wave).
Then up came the cellphone photo of me and
Shawna Kelly, Frito-pie
baker. The two of us cheek
to cheek, beaming pearly
whites. Then the real

Shawna
appeared
onscreen,
tanned
and
sculpted and somber as
Ellen introduced her to
America.
Pinpricks
of
sweat erupted all over me.
ELLEN: So,
Lance
Nicholas
Dunne—can you
describe
his
demeanor for us,
Shawna?
You
meet
him
as

everyone is out
searching for his
missing wife, and
Lance
Nicholas
Dunne
is … what?
SHAWNA:
He
was
very
calm,
very
friendly.
ELLEN:
Excuse me, excuse
me.
He
was

friendly and calm?
His
wife
is
missing, Shawna.
What kind of man
is friendly and
calm?
The grotesque photo
appeared on-screen again.
We somehow looked even
more cheerful.
SHAWNA:
He was actually a
little flirty …

You should have been
nicer to her, Nick. You
should have eaten the
fucking pie.
ELLEN:
Flirty? While his
wife
is
God
knows where and
Lance
Dunne
is … well, Iʼm
sorry,
Shawna,
but this photo is
just … I donʼt

know a better
word
than
disgusting. This is
not
how
an
innocent
man
looks …
The rest of the segment
was basically Ellen Abbott,
professional hatemonger,
obsessing over my lack of
alibi: “Why doesnʼt Lance
Nicholas Dunne have an
alibi until noon? Where

was he that morning?” she
drawled in her Texas
sheriffʼs accent. Her panel
of guests agreed that it
didnʼt look good.
I phoned Go and she
said, “Well, you made it
almost a week without
them turning on you,” and
we cursed for a while.
Fucking Shawna crazy bitch
whore.
“Do something really,

really
useful
today,
active,”
Go
advised.
“People will be watching
now.”
“I couldnʼt sit still if I
wanted to.”
I drove to St. Louis in a
near rage, replaying the
TV segment in my head,
answering all of Ellenʼs
questions, shutting her up.
Today, Ellen Abbott, you
fucking cunt, I tracked down

one of Amyʼs stalkers. Desi
Collings. I tracked him down
to get the truth. Me, the
hero husband. If I had
soaring theme music, I
would have played it. Me,
the nice working-class guy,
taking on the spoiled rich
kid. The media would have
to bite at that: Obsessive
stalkers
are
more
intriguing than run-of-themill wife killers. The

Elliotts, at least, would
appreciate it. I dialed
Marybeth, but just got
voice mail. Onward.
As I rolled into his
neighborhood, I had to
change my Desi vision
from rich to extremely,
sickly wealthy. The guy
lived in a mansion in
Ladue that probably cost
at
least
$5
million.
Whitewashed brick, black

lacquer shutters, gaslight,
and ivy. Iʼd dressed for the
meeting, a decent suit and
tie, but I realized as I rang
his doorbell that a fourhundred-dollar suit in this
neighborhood was more
poignant than if Iʼd shown
up in jeans. I could hear a
clattering of dress shoes
coming from the back of
the house to the front, and
the door opened with a

desuctioning sound, like a
refrigerator. Cold air rolled
out toward me.
Desi looked the way I
had always wanted to
look:
like
a
very
handsome, very decent
fellow. Something in the
eyes, or the jaw. He had
deep-set almond eyes,
teddy-bear
eyes,
and
dimples in both cheeks. If
you saw the two of us

together, youʼd assume he
was the good guy.
“Oh,”
Desi
said,
studying my face. “Youʼre
Nick. Nick Dunne. Good
God, Iʼm so sorry about
Amy. Come in, come in.”
He ushered me into a
severe
living
room,
manliness as envisioned by
a decorator. Lots of dark,
uncomfortable leather. He
pointed me toward an

armchair
with
a
particularly rigid back; I
tried to make myself
comfortable, as urged, but
found the only posture the
chair allowed was that of a
chastised student: Pay
attention and sit up.
Desi didnʼt ask me why
I was in his living room.
Or explain how heʼd
immediately
recognized
me. Although they were

becoming more common,
the double takes and
cupped whispers.
“May I get you a
drink?”
Desi
asked,
pressing
two
hands
together: business first.
“Iʼm fine.”
He sat down opposite
me. He was dressed in
impeccable shades of navy
and cream; even his
shoelaces looked pressed.

He carried it all off,
though. He wasnʼt the
dismissible fop Iʼd been
hoping for. Desi seemed
the
definition
of
a
gentleman: a guy who
could quote a great poet,
order a rare Scotch, and
buy a woman the right
piece of vintage jewelry.
He seemed, in fact, a man
who knew inherently what
women
wanted—across

from him, I felt my suit
wilt, my manner go
clumsy. I had a swelling
urge to discuss football
and fart. These were the
kinds of guys who always
got to me.
“Amy. Any leads?” Desi
asked.
He looked like someone
familiar, an actor, maybe.
“No good ones.”
“She was taken … from

the home. Is that correct?”
“From our home, yes.”
Then I knew who he
was: He was the guy
whoʼd shown up alone the
first day of searches, the
guy who kept sneaking
looks at Amyʼs photo.
“You were at the
volunteer center, werenʼt
you? The first day.”
“I was,” Desi said,
reasonable. “I was about to

say that. I wish Iʼd been
able to meet you that day,
express my condolences.”
“Long way to come.”
“I could say the same to
you.” He smiled. “Look,
Iʼm really fond of Amy.
Hearing
what
had
happened, well, I had to
do something. I just—Itʼs
terrible to say this, Nick,
but when I saw it on the
news, I just thought, Of

course.”
“Of course?”
“Of course someone
would … want her,” he
said. He had a deep voice,
a fireside voice. “You
know, she always had that
way. Of making people
want her. Always. You
know that old cliché: Men
want her, and women
want to be her. With Amy,
that was true.”

Desi folded large hands
across his trousers. Not
pants, trousers. I couldnʼt
decide if he was fucking
with me. I told myself to
tread lightly. Itʼs the rule
of all potentially prickly
interviews: Donʼt go on the
offense until you have to,
first see if theyʼll hang
themselves all on their
own.
“You had a very intense

relationship with Amy,
right?” I asked.
“It wasnʼt only her
looks,” Desi said. He
leaned on a knee, his eyes
distant.
“Iʼve
thought
about this a lot, of course.
First love. Iʼve definitely
thought about it. The
navel-gazer in me. Too
much philosophy.” He
cracked a self-effacing
grin. The dimples popped.

“See, when Amy likes you,
when sheʼs interested in
you, her attention is so
warm and reassuring and
entirely enveloping. Like a
warm bath.”
I raised my eyebrows.
“Bear with me,” he
said. “You feel good about
yourself. Completely good,
for maybe the first time.
And then she sees your
flaws, she realizes youʼre

just another regular person
she has to deal with—you
are, in actuality, Able
Andy, and in real life, Able
Andy would never make it
with Amazing Amy. So her
interest fades, and you
stop feeling good, you can
feel that old coldness
again, like youʼre naked on
the bathroom floor, and all
you want is to get back in
the bath.”

I knew that feeling—Iʼd
been on the bathroom
floor for about three years
—and I felt a rush of
disgust for sharing this
emotion with this other
man.
“Iʼm sure you know
what I mean,” Desi said,
and smiled winkily at me.
What an odd man, I
thought. Who compares
another manʼs wife to a bath

he wants to sink into?
Another manʼs missing
wife?
Behind Desi was a long,
polished end table bearing
several
silver-framed
photos. In the center was
an oversize one of Desi
and Amy back in high
school, in tennis whites—
the two so preposterously
stylish, so monied-lush
they could have been a

frame from a Hitchcock
movie. I pictured Desi,
teenage Desi, slipping into
Amyʼs
dorm
room,
dropping his clothes to the
floor, settling onto the cold
sheets, swallowing plasticcoated pills. Waiting to be
found. It was a form of
punishment, of rage, but
not the kind that occurred
in my house. I could see
why the police werenʼt

that interested. Desi trailed
my glance.
“Oh, well, you canʼt
blame me for that.” He
smiled. “I mean, would you
throw away a photo that
perfect?”
“Of a girl I hadnʼt
known for twenty years?” I
said before I could stop. I
realized my tone sounded
more aggressive than was
wise.

“I know Amy,” Desi
snapped. He took a breath.
“I knew her. I knew her
very well. There arenʼt any
leads? I have to ask … Her
father, is he … there?”
“Of course he is.”
“I donʼt suppose … He
was definitely in New York
when it happened?”
“He was in New York.
Why?”
Desi shrugged: Just

curious, no reason. We sat
in silence for a half
minute, playing a game of
eye-contact
chicken.
Neither of us blinked.
“I actually came here,
Desi, to see what you
could tell me.”
I tried again to picture
Desi making off with Amy.
Did he have a lake house
somewhere nearby? All
these types did. Would it

be believable, this refined,
sophisticated man keeping
Amy in some preppy
basement rec room, Amy
pacing the carpet, sleeping
on a dusty sofa in some
bright, clubby ʼ60s color,
lemon yellow or coral. I
wished Boney and Gilpin
were here, had witnessed
the proprietary tone of
Desiʼs voice: I know Amy.
“Me?” Desi laughed. He

laughed richly. The perfect
phrase to describe the
sound. “I canʼt tell you
anything. Like you said, I
donʼt know her.”
“But you just said you
did.”
“I certainly donʼt know
her like you know her.”
“You stalked her in
high school.”
“I stalked her? Nick.
She was my girlfriend.”

“Until she wasnʼt,” I
said. “And you wouldnʼt
go away.”
“Oh, I probably did
pine for her. But nothing
out of the ordinary.”
“You call trying to kill
yourself in her dorm room
ordinary?”
He jerked his head,
squinted his eyes. He
opened his mouth to
speak, then stared down at

his hands. “Iʼm not sure
what youʼre talking about,
Nick,” he finally said.
“Iʼm talking about you
stalking my wife. In high
school. Now.”
“Thatʼs really what this
is about?” He laughed
again. “Good God, I
thought you were raising
money for a reward fund
or something. Which Iʼm
happy to cover, by the

way. Like I said, Iʼve never
stopped wanting the best
for Amy. Do I love her?
No. I donʼt know her
anymore, not really. We
exchange the occasional
letter. But it is interesting,
you coming here. You
confusing
the
issue.
Because I have to tell you,
Nick, on TV, hell, here,
now, you donʼt seem to be
a
grieving,
worried

husband.
You
seem … smug. The police,
by the way, already talked
with me, thanks, I guess to
you. Or Amyʼs parents.
Strange you didnʼt know—
youʼd think theyʼd tell the
husband everything if he
were in the clear.”
My stomach clenched.
“Iʼm here because I wanted
to see for myself your face
when you talked about

Amy,” I said. “I gotta tell
you, it worries me. You get
a little … moony.”
“One of us has to,” Desi
said, again reasonably.
“Sweetheart?” A voice
came from the back of the
house, and another set of
expensive shoes clattered
toward the living room.
“What was the name of
that book—”
The woman was a

blurry vision of Amy, Amy
in a steam-fogged mirror—
exact coloring, extremely
similar features, but a
quarter century older, the
flesh, the features, all let
out a bit like a fine fabric.
She was still gorgeous, a
woman who chose to age
gracefully. She was shaped
like some sort of origami
creation:
elbows
in
extreme points, a clothes-

hanger collarbone. She
wore a china-blue sheath
dress and had the same
pull Amy did: When she
was in a room, you kept
turning your head back
her way. She gave me a
rather predatory smile.
“Hello, Iʼm Jacqueline
Collings.”
“Mother, this is Amyʼs
husband, Nick,” Desi said.
“Amy.” The woman

smiled again. She had a
bottom-of-a-well
voice,
deep
and
strangely
resonant. “Weʼve been
quite interested in that
story around here. Yes,
very
interested.”
She
turned coldly to her son.
“We can never stop
thinking about the superb
Amy Elliott, can we?”
“Amy Dunne now,” I
said.

“Of course,” Jacqueline
agreed. “Iʼm so sorry, Nick,
for what youʼre going
through.” She stared at me
a moment. “Iʼm sorry, I
must … I didnʼt picture
Amy
with
such
an … American boy.” She
seemed to be speaking
neither to me nor to Desi.
“Good God, he even has a
cleft chin.”
“I came over to see if

your
son
had
any
information,” I said. “I
know heʼs written my wife
a lot of letters over the
years.”
“Oh,
the
letters!”
Jacqueline smiled angrily.
“Such an interesting way
to spend oneʼs time, donʼt
you think?”
“Amy shared them with
you?” Desi asked. “Iʼm
surprised.”

“No,” I said, turning to
him. “She threw them
away unopened, always.”
“All of them? Always?
You know that?” Desi said,
still smiling.
“Once I went through
the trash to read one.” I
turned back to Jacqueline.
“Just to see what exactly
was going on.”
“Good
for
you,”
Jacqueline said, purring at

me. “Iʼd expect nothing
less of my husband.”
“Amy and I always
wrote each other letters,”
Desi said. He had his
motherʼs cadence, the
delivery that indicated
everything he said was
something youʼd want to
hear. “It was our thing. I
find e-mail so … cheap.
And no one saves them. No
one saves an e-mail,

because itʼs so inherently
impersonal. I worry about
posterity in general. All
the great love letters—
from Simone de Beauvoir
to Sartre, from Samuel
Clemens to his wife, Olivia
—I donʼt know, I always
think about what will be
lost—”
“Have you kept all my
letters?” Jacqueline asked.
She was standing at the

fireplace, looking down on
us, one long sinewy arm
trailing
along
the
mantelpiece.
“Of course.”
She turned to me with
an elegant shrug. “Just
curious.”
I shivered, was about
to reach out toward the
fireplace for warmth, but
remembered that it was
July. “It seems to me a

rather strange devotion to
keep up all these years,” I
said. “I mean, she didnʼt
write you back.”
That lit up Desiʼs eyes.
“Oh” was all he said, the
sound of someone who
spied a surprise firework.
“It strikes me as odd,
Nick, that youʼd come here
and ask Desi about his
relationship—or
lack
thereof—with your wife,”

Jacqueline Collings said.
“Are you and Amy not
close? I can guarantee you:
Desi has had no genuine
contact with Amy in
decades. Decades.”
“Iʼm just checking in,
Jacqueline. Sometimes you
have to see something for
yourself.”
Jacqueline
started
walking toward the door;
she turned and gave me a

single twist of her head to
assure me that it was time
to go.
“How very intrepid of
you, Nick. Very do-ityourself. Do you build
your own decks too?” She
laughed at the word and
opened the door for me. I
stared at the hollow of her
neck and wondered why
she wasnʼt wearing a
noose of pearls. Women

like this always have thick
strands of pearls to click
and clack. I could smell
her, though, a female
scent,
vaginal
and
strangely lewd.
“It was interesting to
meet you, Nick,” she said.
“Letʼs all hope Amy gets
home safely. Until then,
the next time you want to
get in touch with Desi?”
She pressed a thick,

creamy card into my
hands. “Call our lawyer,
please.”

ELLIOTT
DUNNE
AUGUST

2011

DIARY ENTRY

I know this sounds the

stuff of moony teenage
girls,
but
Iʼve
been
tracking Nickʼs moods.
Toward me. Just to make
sure Iʼm not crazy. Iʼve got
a calendar, and I put
hearts on any day Nick
seems to love me again,
and black squares when he
doesnʼt. The past year was
all black squares, pretty
much.
But now? Nine days of

hearts. In a row. Maybe all
he needed to know was
how much I loved him and
how unhappy Iʼd become.
Maybe he had a change of
heart. Iʼve never loved a
phrase more.
Quiz: After over a year
of coldness, your husband
suddenly seems to love
you again. You:
a) Go on
and on about how

much heʼs hurt
you so he can
apologize
some
more.
b) Give him
the cold shoulder
for a while longer
—so he learns his
lesson!
c) Donʼt
press him about
his new attitude
—know that he

will confide in
you when the
time comes, and
in the meantime,
shower him with
affection so he
feels secure and
loved,
because
thatʼs how this
marriage
thing
works.
d) Demand
to know what

went
wrong;
make him talk
and talk about it
in order to calm
your
own
neuroses.
Answer: C
Itʼs
August,
so
sumptuous that I couldnʼt
bear any more black
squares, but no, itʼs been
nothing but hearts, Nick
acting like my husband,

sweet and loving and
goofy. He orders me
chocolates
from
my
favorite shop in New York
for a treat, and he writes
me a silly poem to go with
them. A limerick, actually:
There once was a
girl from Manhattan
Who slept only
on sheets made of satin
Her husband
slipped and he slided

And their bodies
collided
So they did
something
dirty
in
Latin.
It would be funnier if
our sex life were as
carefree as the rhyme
would suggest. But last
week we did … fuck? Do
it?
Something
more
romantic than have sex but
less cheesy than make love.

He came home from work
and kissed me full on the
lips, and he touched me as
if I were really there. I
almost cried, Iʼd been so
lonely. To be kissed on the
lips by your husband is the
most decadent thing.
What else? He takes me
swimming in the same
pond heʼs gone to since he
was a child. I can picture
little Nick flapping around

manically,
face
and
shoulders sunburned red
because (just like now) he
refuses to wear sunscreen,
forcing Mama Mo to chase
after him with lotion that
she swipes on whenever
she can reach him.
Heʼs been taking me on
a full tour of his boyhood
haunts, like I asked him to
for ages. He walks me to
the edge of the river, and

he kisses me as the wind
whips my hair (“My two
favorite things to look at
in the world,” he whispers
in my ear). He kisses me in
a funny little playground
fort
that
he
once
considered
his
own
clubhouse
(“I
always
wanted to bring a girl
here, a perfect girl, and
look at me now,” he
whispers in my ear). Two

days before the mall closes
for good, we ride carousel
bunnies side by side, our
laughter echoing through
the empty miles.
He takes me for a
sundae at his favorite ice
cream parlor, and we have
the place to ourselves in
the morning, the air all
sticky with sweets. He
kisses me and says this
place is where he stuttered

and suffered through so
many dates, and he wishes
he could have told his high
school self that he would
be back here with the girl
of his dreams someday. We
eat ice cream until we
have to roll home and get
under the covers. His hand
on my belly, an accidental
nap.
The neurotic in me, of
course, is asking: Whereʼs

the
catch?
Nickʼs
turnaround is so sudden
and so grandiose, it feels
like … it feels like he must
want something. Or heʼs
already done something
and
he
is
being
preemptively sweet for
when I find out. I worry. I
caught him last week
shuffling through my thick
file box marked THE
DUNNES! (written in my

best cursive in happier
days), a box filled with all
the strange paperwork that
makes up a marriage, a
combined life. I worry that
he is going to ask me for a
second mortgage on The
Bar, or to borrow against
our life insurance, or to
sell off some not-to-betouched-for-thirty-years
stock. He said he just
wanted to make sure

everything was in order,
but he said it in a fluster.
My heart would break, it
really would, if, midbite of
bubblegum ice cream, he
turned to me and said: You
know, the interesting thing
about a second mortgage
is …
I had to write that, I
had to let that out. And
just seeing it, I know it
sounds crazy. Neurotic and

insecure and suspicious.
I will not let my worst
self ruin my marriage. My
husband loves me. He
loves me and he has come
back to me and that is why
he is treating me so nice.
That is the only reason.
Just like that: Here is
my life. Itʼs finally returned.

NICK DUNNE
FIVE DAYS GONE

I sat in the billowing
heat of my car outside
Desiʼs house, the windows
rolled down, and checked
my phone. A message from
Gilpin: “Hi, Nick. We need
to touch base today,

update you on a few
things, go over a few
questions. Meet us at four
at your house, okay?
Uh … thanks.”
It was the first time Iʼd
been ordered. Not Could
we, weʼd love to, if you
donʼt mind. But We need to.
Meet us …
I glanced at my watch.
Three oʼclock. Best not be
late.

The summer air show—
a parade of jets and prop
planes spinning loops up
and down the Mississippi,
buzzing
the
tourist
steamboats, rattling teeth
—was three days off, and
the practice runs were in
high gear by the time
Gilpin and Rhonda arrived.
We were all back in my
living room for the first
time since The Day Of.

My home was right on
a flight path; the noise was
somewhere
between
jackhammer
and
avalanche. My cop buddies
and I tried to jam a
conversation in the spaces
between
the
blasts.
Rhonda
looked
more
birdlike
than
usual—
favoring one leg, then
another, her head moving
all around the room as her

gaze alighted on different
objects, angles—a magpie
looking to line her nest.
Gilpin hovered next to her,
chewing his lip, tapping a
foot. Even the room felt
restive: The afternoon sun
lit up an atomic flurry of
dust motes. A jet shot over
the house, that awful skyrip noise.
“Okay, couple of things
here,” Rhonda said when

the silence returned. She
and Gilpin sat down as if
they both had suddenly
decided to stay awhile.
“Some stuff to get clear on,
some stuff to tell you. All
very routine. And as
always, if you want a
lawyer—”
But I knew from my TV
shows, my movies, that
only guilty guys lawyered
up.
Real,
grieving,

worried,
innocent
husbands did not.
“I donʼt, thanks,” I said.
“I actually have some
information to share with
you. About Amyʼs former
stalker, the guy she dated
back in high school.”
“Desi—uh,
Collins,”
began Gilpin.
“Collings. I know you
all talked to him, I know
you for some reason arenʼt

that interested in him, so I
went to visit him myself
today. To make sure he
seemed … okay. And I
donʼt think he is okay. I
think heʼs someone you all
should look into. Really
look into. I mean, he
moves to St. Louis—”
“He was living in St.
Louis three years before
you all moved back,”
Gilpin said.

“Fine, but heʼs in St.
Louis. Easy drive. Amy
bought a gun because she
was afraid—”
“Desiʼs okay, Nick. Nice
guy,” Rhonda said. “Donʼt
you think? He reminds me
of you, actually. Real
golden boy, baby of the
family.”
“Iʼm a twin. Not the
baby. Iʼm actually three
minutes older.”

Rhonda was clearly
trying to nip at me, see if
she could get a rise, but
even knowing this didnʼt
prevent the angry blood
flush to my stomach every
time she accused me of
being a baby.
“Anyway,”
Gilpin
interrupted. “Both he and
his mother deny that he
ever stalked Amy, or that
he even had much contact

with her these past years
except
the
occasional
note.”
“My wife would tell
you differently. He wrote
Amy for years—years—and
then he shows up here for
the search, Rhonda. Did
you know that? He was
here that first day. You
talked about keeping an
eye out for men inserting
themselves
into
the

investigation—”
“Desi Collings is not a
suspect,” she interrupted,
one hand up.
“But—”
“Desi Collings is not a
suspect,” she repeated.
The news stung. I
wanted to accuse her of
being swayed by Ellen
Abbott, but Ellen Abbott
was probably best left
unmentioned.

“Okay, well what about
all these, these guys
whoʼve clogged up our tip
line?” I walked over and
grabbed the sheet of
names and numbers that
Iʼd carelessly tossed on the
dining room table. I began
reading names. “Inserting
themselves
into
the
investigation:
David
Samson, Murphy Clark—
those are old boyfriends—

Tommy OʼHara, Tommy
OʼHara, Tommy OʼHara,
thatʼs three calls, Tito
Puente—thatʼs just a dumb
joke.”
“Have you phoned any
of them back?” Boney
asked.
“No. Isnʼt that your
job? I donʼt know which
are worthwhile and which
are crazies. I donʼt have
time to call some jackass

pretending to be Tito
Puente.”
“I wouldnʼt put too
much emphasis on the tip
line, Nick,” Rhonda said.
“Itʼs kind of a woodwork
situation. I mean, weʼve
fielded a lot of phone calls
from your old girlfriends.
Just want to say hi. See
how you are. People are
strange.”
“Maybe we should get

started on our questions,”
Gilpin nudged.
“Right. Well, I guess we
should begin with where
you were the morning
your wife went missing,”
Boney
said,
suddenly
apologetic, deferential. She
was playing good cop, and
we both knew she was
playing good cop. Unless
she was actually on my
side. It seemed possible

that sometimes a cop was
just on your side. Right?
“When I was at the
beach.”
“And you still canʼt
recall anyone seeing you
there?” Boney asked. “Itʼd
help us so much if we
could just cross this little
thing off our list.” She
allowed a sympathetic
silence. Rhonda could not
only keep quiet, she could

infuse the room with a
mood of her choosing, like
an octopus and its ink.
“Believe me, Iʼd like
that as much as you. But
no. I donʼt remember
anyone.”
Boney smiled a worried
smile. “Itʼs strange, weʼve
mentioned—just in passing
—your being at the beach
to a few people, and they
all said … They were all

surprised, letʼs put it that
way. Said that didnʼt
sound like you. You arenʼt
a beach guy.”
I shrugged. “I mean, do
I go to the beach and lay
out all day? No. But to sip
my coffee in the morning?
Sure.”
“Hey, this might help,”
Boney
said
brightly.
“Whereʼd you buy your
coffee that morning?” She

turned to Gilpin as if to
seek approval. “Could
tighten the time frame at
least, right?”
“I made it here,” I said.
“Oh.” She frowned.
“Thatʼs weird, because you
donʼt have any coffee here.
Nowhere in the house. I
remember thinking it was
odd. A caffeine addict
notices these things.”
Right, just something you

happened to notice, I
thought. I knew a cop
named
Bony
Moronie … Her traps are so
obvious, theyʼre clearly
phony …
“I had a leftover cup in
the fridge I heated up.” I
shrugged again: No big
deal.
“Huh. Must have been
there a long time—I
noticed thereʼs no coffee

container in the trash.”
“Few days. Still tastes
good.”
We both smiled at each
other: I know and you
know. Game on. I actually
thought
those
idiotic
words: Game on. Yet I was
pleased in a way: The next
part was starting.
Boney turned to Gilpin,
hands on knees, and gave
a little nod. Gilpin chewed

his lip some more, then
finally pointed: toward the
ottoman, the end table, the
living room now righted.
“See, hereʼs our problem,
Nick,” he started. “Weʼve
seen dozens of home
invasions—”
“Dozens upon dozens
upon
dozens,”
Boney
interrupted.
“Many home invasions.
This—all this area right

there, in the living room—
remember
it?
The
upturned ottoman, the
overturned table, the vase
on the floor”—he slapped
down a photo of the scene
in front of me—“this
whole
area,
it
was
supposed to look like a
struggle, right?”
My head expanded and
snapped back into place.
Stay calm. “Supposed to?”

“It
looked
wrong,”
Gilpin continued. “From
the second we saw it. To
be honest, the whole thing
looked staged. First of all,
thereʼs the fact that it was
all centered in this one
spot. Why wasnʼt anything
messed up anywhere but
this room? Itʼs odd.” He
proffered another photo, a
close-up. “And look here,
at this pile of books. They

should be in front of the
end table—the end table is
where they were stacked,
right?”
I nodded.
“So when the end table
was knocked over, they
should have spilled mostly
in front of it, following the
trajectory of the falling
table. Instead, theyʼre back
behind it, as if someone
swept them off before

knocking over the table.”
I stared dumbly at the
photo.
“And watch this. This is
very curious to me,” Gilpin
continued. He pointed at
three
slender
antique
frames on the mantelpiece.
He stomped heavily, and
they all flopped facedown
immediately.
“But
somehow
they
stayed
upright through everything

else.”
He showed a photo of
the frames upright. I had
been hoping—even after
they caught my Houstonʼs
dinner slipup—that they
were dumb cops, cops
from the movies, local
rubes aiming to please,
trusting the local guy:
Whatever you say, buddy. I
didnʼt get dumb cops.
“I donʼt know what you

want me to say,” I
mumbled. “Itʼs totally— I
just donʼt know what to
think about this. I just
want to find my wife.”
“So do we, Nick, so do
we,” Rhonda said. “But
hereʼs another thing. The
ottoman—remember how
it was flipped upside
down?” She patted the
squatty ottoman, pointed
at its four peg legs, each

only an inch high. “See,
this thing is bottom-heavy
because of those tiny legs.
The cushion practically sits
on the floor. Try to push it
over.” I hesitated. “Go on,
try it,” Boney urged.
I gave it a push, but it
slid across the carpet
instead of turning over. I
nodded. I agreed. It was
bottom-heavy.
“Seriously, get down

there if you need to, and
knock that thing upside
down,” Boney ordered.
I knelt down, pushed
from lower and lower
angles, finally put a hand
underneath the ottoman,
and flipped it. Even then it
lifted
up,
one
side
hovering, and fell back
into place; I finally had to
pick it up and turn it over
manually.

“Weird, huh?” Boney
said, not sounding all that
puzzled.
“Nick, you do any
housecleaning the day
your wife went missing?”
Gilpin asked.
“No.”
“Okay, because the
tech did a Luminol sweep,
and Iʼm sorry to tell you,
the kitchen floor lit up. A
good amount of blood was

spilled there.”
“Amyʼs
type—B
positive.”
Boney
interrupted, “And Iʼm not
talking a little cut, Iʼm
talking blood.”
“Oh my God.” A clot of
heat appeared in the
middle of my chest. “But
—”
“Yes, so your wife
made it out of this room,”
Gilpin said. “Somehow, in

theory, she made it into
the
kitchen—without
disturbing any of those
gewgaws on that table just
outside the kitchen—and
then she collapsed in the
kitchen, where she lost a
lot of blood.”
“And then someone
carefully mopped it up,”
Rhonda said, watching me.
“Wait.
Wait.
Why
would someone try to hide

blood but then mess up the
living room—”
“Weʼll figure that out,
donʼt
worry,
Nick,”
Rhonda said quietly.
“I donʼt get it, I just
donʼt—”
“Letʼs sit down,” Boney
said. She pointed me
toward a dining room
chair. “You eat anything
yet? Want a sandwich,
something?”

I shook my head.
Boney was taking turns
playing different female
characters:
powerful
woman, doting caregiver,
to see what got the best
results.
“Howʼs your marriage,
Nick?” Rhonda asked. “I
mean, five years, thatʼs not
far from the seven-year
itch.”
“The marriage was

fine,” I repeated. “Itʼs fine.
Not perfect, but good,
good.”
She wrinkled her nose:
You lie.
“You think she might
have run off?” I asked, too
hopefully. “Made this look
like a crime scene and
took off? Runaway-wife
thing?”
Boney began ticking off
reasons no: “She hasnʼt

used her cell, she hasnʼt
used her credit cards, ATM
cards. She made no major
cash withdrawals in the
weeks before.”
“And
thereʼs
the
blood,” Gilpin added. “I
mean, again, I donʼt want
to sound harsh, but the
amount of blood spilled?
That would take some
serious … I mean, I
couldnʼt have done it to

myself. Iʼm talking some
deep wounds there. Your
wife got nerves of steel?”
“Yes. She does.” She
also had a deep phobia of
blood, but Iʼd wait and let
the brilliant detectives
figure that out.
“It seems extremely
unlikely,” Gilpin said. “If
she were to wound herself
that seriously, why would
she mop it up?”

“So really, letʼs be
honest, Nick,” Boney said,
leaning over on her knees
so she could make eye
contact with me as I stared
at the floor. “How was
your marriage currently?
Weʼre on your side, but we
need the truth. The only
thing that makes you look
bad is you holding out on
us.”
“Weʼve had bumps.” I

saw Amy in the bedroom
that last night, her face
mottled with the red hivey
splotches she got when she
was angry. She was
spitting out the words—
mean, wild words—and I
was listening to her, trying
to accept the words
because they were true,
they were technically true,
everything she said.
“Describe the bumps

for us,” Boney said.
“Nothing specific, just
disagreements. I mean,
Amy is a blow-stack. She
bottles up a bunch of little
stuff and—whoom!—but
then itʼs over. We never
went to bed angry.”
“Not
Wednesday
night?” Boney asked.
“Never,” I lied.
“Is it money, what you
mostly argue about?”

“I canʼt even think
what weʼd argue about.
Just stuff.”
“What stuff was it the
night she went missing?”
Gilpin said it with a
sideways grin, like heʼd
uttered
the
most
unbelievable gotcha.
“Like I told you, there
was the lobster.”
“What else? Iʼm sure
you didnʼt scream about

the lobster for a whole
hour.”
At that point Bleecker
waddled partway down
the stairs and peered
through the railings.
“Other household stuff
too. Married-couple stuff.
The cat box,” I said. “Who
would clean the cat box.”
“You
were
in
a
screaming argument about
a cat box,” Boney said.

“You
know,
the
principle of the thing. I
work a lot of hours, and
Amy doesnʼt, and I think it
would be good for her if
she did some basic home
maintenance. Just basic
upkeep.”
Gilpin jolted like an
invalid woken from an
afternoon nap. “Youʼre an
old-fashioned guy, right?
Iʼm the same way. I tell

my wife all the time, ʻI
donʼt know how to iron, I
donʼt know how to do the
dishes. I canʼt cook. So,
sweetheart, Iʼll catch the
bad guys, that I can do,
and you throw some
clothes in the washer now
and then.ʼ Rhonda, you
were married, did you do
the domestic stuff at
home?”
Boney
looked

believably annoyed. “I
catch bad guys too, idiot.”
Gilpin rolled his eyes
toward me; I almost
expected him to make a
joke—sounds
like
someoneʼs on the rag—the
guy was laying it on so
thick.
Gilpin
rubbed
his
vulpine jaw. “So you just
wanted a housewife,” he
said to me, making the

proposition
seem
reasonable.
“I wanted—I wanted
whatever Amy wanted. I
really didnʼt care.” I
appealed to Boney now,
Detective Rhonda Boney
with the sympathetic air
that seemed at least partly
authentic. (Itʼs not, I
reminded myself.) “Amy
couldnʼt decide what to do
here. She couldnʼt find a

job, and she wasnʼt
interested in The Bar.
Which is fine, if you want
to stay home, thatʼs fine, I
said. But when she stayed
home, she was unhappy
too. And sheʼd wait for me
to fix it. It was like I was
in
charge
of
her
happiness.”
Boney said nothing,
gave
me
a
face
expressionless as water.

“And, I mean, itʼs fun
to be hero for a while, be
the white knight, but it
doesnʼt really work for
long. I couldnʼt make her
be happy. She didnʼt want
to be happy. So I thought
if she started taking charge
of a few practical things—”
“Like the cat box,” said
Boney.
“Yeah, clean the cat
box, get some groceries,

call a plumber to fix the
drip that drove her crazy.”
“Wow, that sounds like
a real happiness plan
there. Lotta yuks.”
“But my point was, do
something. Whatever it is,
do something. Make the
most of the situation.
Donʼt sit and wait for me
to fix everything for you.”
I was speaking loudly, I
realized, and I sounded

almost angry, certainly
righteous, but it was such
a relief. Iʼd started with a
lie—the
cat
box—and
turned
that
into
a
surprising burst of pure
truth, and I realized why
criminals talked too much,
because it feels so good to
tell your story to a
stranger, someone who
wonʼt
call
bullshit,
someone forced to listen to

your
side.
(Someone
pretending to listen to your
side, I corrected.)
“So the move back to
Missouri?” Boney said.
“You moved Amy here
against her wishes?”
“Against her wishes? No.
We did what we had to do.
I had no job, Amy had no
job, my mom was sick. Iʼd
do the same for Amy.”
“Thatʼs nice of you to

say,” Boney muttered. And
suddenly she reminded me
exactly of Amy: the
damning
below-breath
retorts uttered at the
perfect level, so I was
pretty sure I heard them
but couldnʼt swear to it.
And if I asked what I was
supposed to ask—What did
you say?—sheʼd always say
the same: Nothing. I glared
at Boney, my mouth tight,

and then I thought: Maybe
this is part of the plan, to see
how you act toward angry,
dissatisfied women. I tried
to make myself smile, but
it only seemed to repulse
her more.
“And youʼre able to
afford this, Amy working,
not working, whatever,
you
could
swing
it
financially?” Gilpin asked.
“Weʼve
had
some

money problems of late,” I
said. “When we first
married,
Amy
was
wealthy, like extremely
wealthy.”
“Right,” said Boney,
“those
Amazing
Amy
books.”
“Yeah, they made a ton
of money in the eighties
and nineties. But the
publisher dropped them.
Said Amy had run her

course. And everything
went south. Amyʼs parents
had to borrow money from
us to stay afloat.”
“From your wife, you
mean?”
“Right, fine. And then
we used most of the last of
Amyʼs trust fund to buy
the bar, and Iʼve been
supporting us since.”
“So when you married
Amy,
she
was
very

wealthy,” Gilpin said. I
nodded. I was thinking of
the hero narrative: the
husband who sticks by his
wife through the horrible
decline in her familyʼs
circumstances.
“So you had a very nice
lifestyle.”
“Yeah, it was great, it
was awesome.”
“And now sheʼs near
broke, and youʼre dealing

with a very different
lifestyle than what you
married into. What you
signed on for.”
I realized my narrative
was completely wrong.
“Because, okay, weʼve
been going over your
finances, Nick, and dang,
they donʼt look good,”
Gilpin
started,
almost
turning the accusation into
a concern, a worry.

“The Bar is doing
decent,” I said. “It usually
takes a new business three
or four years to get out of
the red.”
“Itʼs those credit cards
that got my attention,”
Boney said. “Two hundred
and
twelve
thousand
dollars in credit-card debt.
I mean, it took my breath
away.” She fanned a stack
of red-ink statements at

me.
My
parents
were
fanatics about credit cards
—used only for special
purposes, paid off every
month. We donʼt buy what
we canʼt pay for. It was the
Dunne family motto.
“We donʼt—I donʼt, at
least—but I donʼt think
Amy would—Can I see
those?” I stuttered, just as
a
low-flying
bomber

rattled the windowpanes.
A plant on the mantel
promptly lost five pretty
purple leaves. Forced into
silence for ten brainshaking seconds, we all
watched the leaves flutter
to the ground.
“Yet this great brawl
weʼre supposed to believe
happened in here, and not
a petal was on the floor
then,” Gilpin muttered

disgustedly.
I took the papers from
Boney and saw my name,
only my name, versions of
it—Nick Dunne, Lance
Dunne, Lance N. Dunne,
Lance Nicholas Dunne, on
a dozen different credit
cards,
balances
from
$62.78 to $45,602.33, all
in
various
states
of
lateness,
terse
threats
printed
in
ominous

lettering across the top:
pay now.
“Holy fuck! This is,
like, identity theft or
something!”
I
said.
“Theyʼre not mine. I mean,
freakinʼ look at some of
this stuff: I donʼt even
golf.” Someone had paid
over
seven
thousand
dollars for a set of clubs.
“Anyone can tell you: I
really donʼt golf.” I tried to

make it sound self-effacing
—yet another thing Iʼm not
good at—but the detectives
werenʼt biting.
“You
know
Noelle
Hawthorne?” Boney asked.
“The friend of Amyʼs you
told us to check out?”
“Wait, I want to talk
about the bills, because
they are not mine,” I said.
“I mean, please, seriously,
we need to track this

down.”
“Weʼll track it down,
no problem,” Boney said,
expressionless.
“Noelle
Hawthorne?”
“Right. I told you to
check her out because
sheʼs been all over town,
wailing about Amy.”
Boney
arched
an
eyebrow. “You seem angry
about that.”
“No, like I told you, she

seems a little too broken
up, like in a fake way.
Ostentatious.
Attentionseeking. A little obsessed.”
“We talked to Noelle,”
Boney said. “Says your
wife
was
extremely
troubled by the marriage,
was upset about the
money stuff, that she
worried youʼd married her
for her money. She says
your wife worried about

your temper.”
“I donʼt know why
Noelle would say that; I
donʼt think she and Amy
ever exchanged more than
five words.”
“Thatʼs funny, because
the Hawthornesʼ living
room is covered with
photos of Noelle and your
wife.” Boney frowned. I
frowned too: actual real
pictures of her and Amy?

Boney continued: “At
the St. Louis zoo last
October, on a picnic with
the triplets, on a weekend
float trip this past June. As
in last month.”
“Amy has never uttered
the name Noelle in the
entire time weʼve lived
here. Iʼm serious.” I
scanned my brain over this
past June and came upon a
weekend I went away with

Andie, told Amy I was
doing a boysʼ trip to St.
Louis. Iʼd returned home
to find her pink-cheeked
and angry, claiming a
weekend of bad cable and
bored reading on the dock.
And she was on a float
trip? No. I couldnʼt think
of anything Amy would
care for less than the
typical midwestern float
trip: beers bobbing in

coolers tied to canoes,
loud music, drunk frat
boys, campgrounds dotted
with vomit. “Are you sure
it was my wife in those
photos?”
They gave each other a
he serious? look.
“Nick,” Boney said. “We
have no reason to believe
that the woman in the
photos who looks exactly
like your wife and who

Noelle
Hawthorne,
a
mother of three, your
wifeʼs best friend here in
town, says is your wife, is
not your wife.”
“Your wife who—I
should say—according to
Noelle, you married for
money,” Gilpin added.
“Iʼm not joking,” I said.
“Anyone these days can
doctor photos on a laptop.”
“Okay, so a minute ago

you
were
sure
Desi
Collings was involved, and
now youʼve moved on to
Noelle Hawthorne,” Gilpin
said. “It seems like youʼre
really casting about for
someone to blame.”
“Besides me? Yes, I am.
Look, I did not marry Amy
for her money. You really
should talk more with
Amyʼs parents. They know
me,
they
know
my

character.” They
donʼt
know everything, I thought,
my stomach seizing. Boney
was watching me; she
looked sort of sorry for
me. Gilpin didnʼt even
seem to be listening.
“You bumped up the
life insurance coverage on
your wife to one-point-two
million,” Gilpin said with
mock weariness. He even
pulled a hand over his

long, thin-jawed face.
“Amy did that herself!”
I said quickly. The cops
both just looked at me and
waited. “I mean, I filed the
paperwork, but it was
Amyʼs idea. She insisted. I
swear, I couldnʼt care less,
but Amy said—she said,
given the change in her
income, it made her feel
more secure or something,
or it was a smart business

decision. Fuck, I donʼt
know, I donʼt know why
she wanted it. I didnʼt ask
her to.”
“Two
months
ago,
someone did a search on
your
laptop,”
Boney
continued. “Body Float
Mississippi River. Can you
explain that?”
I
took
two
deep
breaths, nine seconds to
pull myself together.

“God, that was just a
dumb book idea,” I said. “I
was thinking about writing
a book.”
“Hunh,” Boney replied.
“Look, hereʼs what I
think is happening,” I
began. “I think a lot of
people watch these news
programs
where
the
husband is always this
awful guy who kills his
wife, and they are seeing

me through that lens, and
some
really
innocent,
normal things are being
twisted. This is turning
into a witch hunt.”
“Thatʼs
how
you
explain those credit-card
bills?” Gilpin asked.
“I told you, I canʼt
explain the fucking creditcard bills because I have
nothing to do with them.
Itʼs your fucking job to

figure out where they
came from!”
They sat silent, side by
side, waiting.
“What
is
currently
being done to find my
wife?” I asked. “What leads
are you exploring, besides
me?”
The
house
began
shaking, the sky ripped,
and through the back
window, we could see a jet

shooting past, right over
the river, buzzing us.
“F-10,” Rhonda said.
“Nah, too small,” Gilpin
said. “Itʼs got to be—”
“Itʼs an F-10.”
Boney leaned toward
me, hands entwined. “Itʼs
our job to make sure you
are in the hundred percent
clear, Nick,” she said. “I
know you want that too.
Now if you can just help

us out with the few little
tangles—because
thatʼs
what they are, they keep
tripping us up.”
“Maybe itʼs time I got a
lawyer.”
The cops exchanged
another look, as if theyʼd
settled a bet.

AMY ELLIOTT
DUNNE
OCTOBER 21,
2011

DIARY ENTRY

Nickʼs mom is dead. I
havenʼt been able to write
because Nickʼs mom is

dead, and her son has
come unmoored. Sweet,
tough Maureen. She was
up and moving around
until days before she died,
refusing to discuss any sort
of slowdown. “I just want
to live until I canʼt
anymore,” she said. Sheʼd
gotten into knitting caps
for other chemo patients
(she herself was done done
done after one round, no

interest in prolonging life
if it meant “more tubes”),
so Iʼll remember her
always surrounded by
bright knots of wool: red
and yellow and green, and
her fingers moving, the
needles
click-clacking
while she talked in her
contented-cat voice, all
deep, sleepy purr.
And then one morning
in September she woke but

didnʼt really wake, didnʼt
become Maureen. She was
a
bird-size
woman
overnight, that fast, all
wrinkles and shell, her
eyes darting around the
room, unable to place
anything,
including
herself. So then came the
hospice, a gently lit,
cheerful
place
with
paintings of women in
bonnets and rolling hills of

bounty,
and
snack
machines,
and
small
coffees. The hospice was
not expected to fix her or
help her but just to make
sure she died comfortably,
and just three days later,
she did. Very matter-offact, the way Maureen
would have wanted it
(although Iʼm sure she
would have rolled her eyes
at that phrase: the way

Maureen would have wanted
it).
Her wake was modest
but nice—with hundreds
of people, her look-alike
sister from Omaha bustling
by proxy, pouring coffee
and Baileys and handing
out cookies and telling
funny stories about Mo.
We buried her on a gusty,
warm morning, Go and
Nick leaning in to each

other as I stood nearby,
feeling intrusive. That
night in bed, Nick let me
put my arms around him,
his back to me, but after a
few minutes he got up,
whispered, “Got to get
some air,” and left the
house.
His mother had always
mothered him—she insisted
on coming by once a week
and ironing for us, and

when she was done
ironing, sheʼd say, “Iʼll just
help tidy,” and after sheʼd
left, Iʼd look in the fridge
and find sheʼd peeled and
sliced his grapefruit for
him, put the pieces in a
snap-top container, and
then Iʼd open the bread
and discover all the crusts
had been cut away, each
slice returned half naked. I
am married to a thirty-

four-year-old man who is
still offended by bread
crusts.
But I tried to do the
same those first weeks
after his mom passed. I
snipped the bread crusts, I
ironed his T-shirts, I baked
a blueberry pie from his
momʼs recipe. “I donʼt
need to be babied, really,
Amy,” he said as he stared
at the loaf of skinned

breads. “I let my mom do
it because it made her
happy, but I know you
donʼt like that nurturing
stuff.”
So weʼre back to black
squares. Sweet, doting,
loving Nick is gone. Gruff,
peeved, angry Nick is
back. You are supposed to
lean on your spouse in
hard times, but Nick seems
to have gone even farther

away. He is a mamaʼs boy
whose mama is dead. He
doesnʼt want anything to
do with me.
He uses me for sex
when he needs to. He
presses me against a table
or over the back of the bed
and fucks me, silent until
the last few moments,
those few quick grunts,
and then he releases me,
he puts a palm on the

small of my back, his one
gesture of intimacy, and he
says something that is
supposed to make it seem
like a game: “Youʼre so
sexy, sometimes I canʼt
control myself.” But he
says it in a dead voice.
Quiz: Your husband,
with whom you once
shared a wonderful sex
life, has turned distant and
cold—he only wants sex

his way, on his time. You:
a) Withhold
sex further—heʼs
not going to win
this game!
b) Cry and
whine
and
demand answers
heʼs not yet ready
to give, further
alienating him.
c) Have
faith that this is

just a bump in a
long marriage—
he is in a dark
place—so try to
be understanding
and wait it out.
Answer: C.
Right?
It bothers me that my
marriage is disintegrating
and I donʼt know what to
do. Youʼd think my
parents,
the
double

psychologists, would be
the obvious people to talk
to, but I have too much
pride. They would not be
good for marital advice:
They are soul mates,
remember? They are all
peaks,
no
valleys—a
single, infinite burst of
marital ecstasy. I canʼt tell
them I am screwing up the
one thing I have left: my
marriage. Theyʼd somehow

write another book, a
fictional rebuke in which
Amazing Amy celebrated
the
most
fantastic,
fulfilling, bump-free little
marriage ever … because
she put her mind to it.
But I worry. All the
time. I know Iʼm already
too old for my husbandʼs
tastes. Because I used to be
his ideal, six years ago,
and so Iʼve heard his

ruthless comments about
women nearing forty: how
pathetic he finds them,
overdressed, out at bars,
oblivious to their lack of
appeal. Heʼd come back
from a night out drinking,
and Iʼd ask him how the
bar was, whatever bar, and
heʼd so often say: “Totally
inundated by Lost Causes,”
his code for women my
age. At the time, a girl

barely in her thirties, Iʼd
smirked along with him as
if that would never happen
to me. Now I am his Lost
Cause, and heʼs trapped
with me, and maybe thatʼs
why heʼs so angry.
Iʼve been indulging in
toddler therapy. I walk
over to Noelleʼs every day
and I let her triplets paw
at me. The little plump
hands in my hair, the

sticky breath on my neck.
You can understand why
women always threaten to
devour children: She is just
to eat! I could eat him with
a
spoon!
Although
watching
her
three
children toddle to her,
sleep-stained from their
nap, rubbing their eyes
while they make their way
to Mama, little hands
touching her knee or arm

as if she were home base,
as if they knew they were
safe … it hurts me
sometimes to watch.
Yesterday I had a
particularly
needful
afternoon at Noelleʼs, so
maybe thatʼs why I did
something stupid.
Nick comes home and
finds me in the bedroom,
fresh from a shower, and
pretty soon he is pushing

me against the wall,
pushing himself inside me.
When he is done and
releases me, I can see the
wet kiss of my mouth
against the blue paint. As
he sits on the edge of the
bed, panting, he says,
“Sorry about that. I just
needed you.”
Not looking at me.
I go to him and put my
arms
around
him,

pretending what weʼd just
done was normal, a
pleasant marital ritual, and
I say, “Iʼve been thinking.”
“Yeah, whatʼs that?”
“Well, now might be
the right time. To start a
family.
Try
to
get
pregnant.” I know itʼs
crazy even as I say it, but I
canʼt help myself—I have
become the crazy woman
who wants to get pregnant

because it will save her
marriage.
Itʼs
humbling,
to
become the very thing you
once mocked.
He jerks away from me.
“Now? Now is about the
worst time to start a
family, Amy. You have no
job—”
“I know, but Iʼd want
to stay home with the
baby anyway at first—”

“My mom just died,
Amy.”
“And this would be
new life, a new start.”
He grips me by both
arms and looks me right in
the eye for the first time in
a week. “Amy, I think you
think that now that my
mom is dead, weʼll just
frolic back to New York
and have some babies, and
youʼll get your old life

back. But we donʼt have
enough money. We barely
have enough money for
the two of us to live here.
You canʼt imagine how
much pressure I feel, every
day, to fix this mess weʼre
in. To fucking provide. I
canʼt handle you and me
and a few kids. Youʼll want
to give them everything
you had growing up, and I
canʼt. No private schools

for the little Dunnes, no
tennis and violin lessons,
no summer homes. Youʼd
hate how poor weʼd be.
Youʼd hate it.”
“Iʼm not that shallow,
Nick—”
“You really think weʼre
in a great place right now,
to have kids?”
It is the closest weʼve
gotten to discussing our
marriage, and I can see he

already regrets saying
something.
“Weʼre under a lot of
pressure, baby,” I say.
“Weʼve had a few bumps,
and I know a lot of it is my
fault. I just feel so at loose
ends here …”
“So weʼre going to be
one of those couples who
has a kid to fix their
marriage? Because that
always works out so well.”

“Weʼll have a baby
because—”
His eyes go dark,
canine, and he grabs me
by the arms again.
“Just … No, Amy. Not
right now. I canʼt take one
more bit of stress. I canʼt
handle one more thing to
worry about. I am cracking
under the pressure. I will
snap.”
For once I know heʼs

telling the truth.

NICK DUNNE
SIX DAYS GONE

The first forty-eight
hours are key in any
investigation. Amy had
been gone, now, almost a
week. A candlelight vigil

would be held this evening
in Tom Sawyer Park,
which, according to the
press, was “a favorite place
of Amy Elliott Dunneʼs.”
(Iʼd never known Amy to
set foot in the park;
despite the name, it is not
remotely quaint. Generic,
bereft of trees, with a
sandbox thatʼs always full
of animal feces; it is
utterly un-Twainy.) In the

last twenty-four hours, the
story had gone national—
it was everywhere, just
like that.
God bless the faithful
Elliotts. Marybeth phoned
me last night, as I was
trying to recover from the
bombshell
police
interrogation. My motherin-law had seen the Ellen
Abbott
show
and
pronounced the woman

“an opportunistic ratings
whore.” Nevertheless, weʼd
spent most of today
strategizing how to handle
the media.
The media (my former
clan, my people!) was
shaping its story, and the
media loved the Amazing
Amy angle and the longmarried Elliotts. No snarky
commentary
on
the
dismantling of the series or

the
authorsʼ
nearbankruptcy—right now it
was all hearts and flowers
for the Elliotts. The media
loved them.
Me, not so much. The
media was already turning
up items of concern. Not
only the stuff that had
been leaked—my lack of
alibi, the possibly “staged”
crime scene—but actual
personality traits. They

reported that back in high
school, Iʼd never dated one
girl longer than a few
months and thus was
clearly a ladiesʼ man. They
found out we had my
father in Comfort Hill and
that I rarely visited, and
thus I was an ingrate dadabandoner. “Itʼs a problem
—they donʼt like you,” Go
said after every bit of news
coverage. “Itʼs a real, real

problem,
Lance.”
The
media had resurrected my
first name, which Iʼd hated
since grade school, stifled
at the start of every school
year when the teacher
called roll: “Itʼs Nick, I go
by
Nick!”
Every
September, an opening-day
rite: “Nick-I-go-by-Nick!”
Always some smart-ass kid
would
spend
recess
parading around like a

mincing gallant: “Hi, Iʼm
Laaaance,” in a flowyshirted voice. Then it
would be forgotten again
until the following year.
But not now. Now it
was all over the news, the
dreaded
three-name
judgment reserved for
serial killers and assassins
—Lance Nicholas Dunne—
and there was no one I
could interrupt.

Rand and Marybeth
Elliott, Go, and I carpooled
to the vigil together. It was
unclear
how
much
information the Elliotts
were receiving, how many
damning updates about
their son-in-law. I knew
they were aware of the
“staged” scene: “Iʼm going
to get some of my own
people in there, and theyʼll
tell us just the opposite—

that it clearly was the
scene of a struggle,” Rand
said confidently. “The
truth is malleable; you just
need to pick the right
expert.”
Rand
didnʼt
know
about the other stuff, the
credit cards and the life
insurance and the blood
and Noelle, my wifeʼs
bitter best friend with the
damning claims: abuse,

greed, fear. She was
booked on Ellen Abbott
tonight, post-vigil. Noelle
and
Ellen
could
be
mutually disgusted by me
for the viewing audience.
Not
everyone
was
repulsed by me. In the past
week, The Barʼs business
was booming: Hundreds of
customers packed in to sip
beers and nibble popcorn
at the place owned by

Lance Nicholas Dunne, the
maybe-killer. Go had to
hire four new kids to tend
The Bar; sheʼd dropped by
once and said she couldnʼt
go again, couldnʼt stand
seeing how packed it was,
fucking gawkers, ghouls,
all drinking our booze and
swapping stories about me.
It was disgusting. Still, Go
reasoned,
the
money
would be helpful if …

If. Amy gone six days,
and we were all thinking
in ifs.
We approached the
park in a car gone silent
except for Marybethʼs
constant nail drumming on
the window.
“Feels almost like a
double
date.”
Rand
laughed,
the
laughter
curving
toward
the
hysterical:
high-pitched

and squeaky. Rand Elliott,
genius psychologist, bestselling author, friend to
all, was unraveling.
Marybeth had taken to
self-medication: shots of
clear liquor administered
with absolute precision,
enough to take the edge
off but stay sharp. Rand,
on the other hand, was
literally losing his head; I
half expected to see it

shoot off his shoulders on
a jack-in-the-box spring—
cuckoooooo!
Randʼs
schmoozy
nature
had
turned manic: He got
desperately chummy with
everyone
he
met,
wrapping his arms around
cops, reporters, volunteers.
He was particularly tight
with
our
Days
Inn
“liaison,” a gawky, shy kid
named Donnie whom Rand

liked to razz and inform he
was doing so. “Ah, Iʼm just
razzing you, Donnie,” heʼd
say, and Donnie would
break into a joyous grin.
“Canʼt that kid go get
validation
somewhere
else?” I groused to Go the
other night. She said I was
just jealous that my father
figure
liked
someone
better. I was.
Marybeth
patted

Randʼs back as we walked
toward the park, and I
thought about how much I
wanted someone to do
that, just a quick touch,
and I suddenly let out a
gasp-sob, one quick teary
moan. I wanted someone,
but I wasnʼt sure if it was
Andie or Amy.
“Nick?” Go said. She
raised a hand toward my
shoulder, but I shrugged

her off.
“Sorry. Wow, sorry for
that,” I said. “Weird
outburst, very un-Dunney.”
“No problem. Weʼre
both coming undone-y,”
Go said, and looked away.
Since
discovering
my
situation—which is what
weʼd taken to calling my
infidelity—sheʼd gotten a
bit removed, her eyes

distant, her face a constant
mull. I was trying very
hard not to resent it.
As we entered the park,
the camera crews were
everywhere, not just local
anymore but network. The
Dunnes and the Elliotts
walked
along
the
perimeter of the crowd,
Rand smiling and nodding
like a visiting dignitary.
Boney and Gilpin appeared

almost immediately, took
to our heels like friendly
pointer dogs; they were
becoming
familiar,
furniture,
which
was
clearly the idea. Boney
was wearing the same
clothes she wore to any
public event: a sensible
black skirt, a gray-striped
blouse, barrettes clipping
either side of her limp
hair. I got a girl named

Bony Moronie … The night
was steamy; under each of
Boneyʼs armpits was a
dark
smiley
face
of
perspiration. She actually
grinned at me as if
yesterday, the accusations
—they were accusations,
werenʼt
they?—hadnʼt
happened.
The Elliotts and I filed
up the steps to a rickety
makeshift stage. I looked

back toward my twin and
she nodded at me and
pantomimed a big breath,
and I remembered to
breathe. Hundreds of faces
were turned toward us,
along
with
clicking,
flashing cameras. Donʼt
smile, I told myself. Do not
smile.
From the front of
dozens of Find Amy Tshirts, my wife studied me.

Go had said I needed to
make a speech (“You need
some humanizing, fast”) so
I did, I walked up to the
microphone. It was too
low, mid-belly, and I
wrestled with it a few
seconds, and it raised only
an inch, the kind of
malfunction that would
normally infuriate me, but
I could no longer be
infuriated in public, so I

took a breath and leaned
down and read the words
that my sister had written
for me: “My wife, Amy
Dunne, has been missing
for almost a week. I cannot
possibly
convey
the
anguish our family feels,
the deep hole in our lives
left
by
Amyʼs
disappearance. Amy is the
love of my life, she is the
heart of her family. For

those who have yet to
meet her, she is funny, and
charming, and kind. She is
wise and warm. She is my
helpmate and partner in
every way.”
I looked up into the
crowd and, like magic,
spotted Andie, a disgusted
look on her face, and I
quickly glanced back at
my notes.
“Amy is the woman I

want to grow old with,
and I know this will
happen.”
PAUSE. BREATHE. NO
SMILE. Go had actually
written the words on my
index card. Happen happen
happen. My voice echoed
out through the speakers,
rolling toward the river.
“We ask you to contact
us with any information.
We light candles tonight in

the hope she comes home
soon and safely. I love you,
Amy.”
I kept my eyes moving
anywhere but Andie. The
park
sparkled
with
candles. A moment of
silence was supposed to be
observed, but babies were
crying, and one stumbling
homeless man kept asking
loudly, “Hey, what is this
about? Whatʼs it for?,” and

someone would whisper
Amyʼs name, and the guy
would say louder, “What?
Itʼs for what?”
From the middle of the
crowd, Noelle Hawthorne
began moving forward, her
triplets affixed, one on a
hip, the other two clinging
to her skirt, all looking
ludicrously tiny to a man
who spent no time around
children. Noelle forced the

crowd to part for her and
the children, marching
right to the edge of the
podium, where she looked
up at me. I glared at her—
the woman had maligned
me—and then I noticed for
the first time the swell in
her belly and realized she
was pregnant again. For
one second, my mouth
dropped—four kids under
four, sweet Jesus!—and

later, that look would be
analyzed and debated,
most people believing it
was a one-two punch of
anger and fear.
“Hey, Nick.” Her voice
caught in the half-raised
microphone and boomed
out to the audience.
I started to fumble with
the mike, but couldnʼt find
the off switch.
“I just wanted to see

your face,” she said, and
burst into tears. A wet sob
rolled
out
over
the
audience, everyone rapt.
“Where is she? What have
you done with Amy? What
have you done with your
wife!”
Wife, wife, her voice
echoed. Two of her
alarmed children began to
wail.
Noelle couldnʼt talk for

a second, she was crying
so hard, she was wild,
furious, and she grabbed
the microphone stand and
yanked the whole thing
down to her level. I
debated grabbing it back
but knew I could do
nothing
toward
this
woman in the maternity
dress with the three
toddlers. I scanned the
crowd for Mike Hawthorne

—control your wife—but he
was
nowhere.
Noelle
turned to address the
crowd.
“I am Amyʼs best
friend!” Friend friend friend.
The words boomed out all
over the park along with
her childrenʼs keening.
“Despite my best efforts,
the police donʼt seem to be
taking me seriously. So Iʼm
taking our cause to this

town, this town that Amy
loved, that loved her back!
This man, Nick Dunne,
needs to answer some
questions. He needs to tell
us what he did to his
wife!”
Boney darted from the
side of the stage to reach
her, and Noelle turned,
and the two locked eyes.
Boney made a frantic
chopping motion at her

throat: Stop talking!
“His pregnant wife!”
And no one could see
the
candles
anymore,
because the flashbulbs
were going berserk. Next
to me, Rand made a noise
like a balloon squeak.
Down below me, Boney
put her fingers between
her
eyebrows
as
if
stanching a headache. I
was seeing everyone in

frantic strobe shots that
matched my pulse.
I looked out into the
crowd for Andie, saw her
staring at me, her face
pink and twisted, her
cheeks damp, and as we
caught each otherʼs eyes,
she mouthed “Asshole!”
and stumbled back away
through the crowd.
“We should go.” My
sister, suddenly beside me,

whispering in my ear,
tugging at my arm. The
cameras flashing at me as I
stood
like
some
Frankensteinʼs
monster,
fearful and agitated by the
villager torches. Flash,
flash. We started moving,
breaking into two parts:
my sister and I fleeing
toward Goʼs car, the
Elliotts standing with jaws
agape, on the platform,

left
behind,
save
yourselves. The reporters
pelted the question over
and over at me. Nick, was
Amy pregnant? Nick, were
you
upset
Amy
was
pregnant? Me, streaking
out of the park, ducking
like I was caught in hail:
Pregnant,
pregnant,
pregnant, the word pulsing
in the summer night in
time to the cicadas.

AMY
ELLIOTT
DUNNE
FEBRUARY
15,
2012

DIARY ENTRY

What a strange time

this is. I have to think that
way, try to examine it
from a distance: Ha-ha,
what an odd period this
will be to look back on,
wonʼt I be amused when
Iʼm eighty, dressed in
faded lavender, a wise,
amused figure swilling
martinis, and wonʼt this
make a story? A strange,
awful story of something I
survived.

Because something is
horribly wrong with my
husband, of that I am sure
now. Yes, heʼs mourning
his mother, but this is
something more. It feels
directed at me, not a
sadness but … I can feel
him
watching
me
sometimes, and I look up
and see his face twisted in
disgust, like heʼs walked in
on me doing something

awful, instead of just
eating cereal in the
morning or combing my
hair at night. Heʼs so
angry, so unstable, Iʼve
been wondering if his
moods are linked to
something physical—one
of those wheat allergies
that turn people mad, or a
colony of mold spores that
has clogged his brain.
I came downstairs the

other night and found him
at the dining room table,
his head in his hands,
looking at a pile of creditcard bills. I watched my
husband, all alone, under
the
spotlight
of
a
chandelier. I wanted to go
to him, to sit down with
him and figure it out like
partners. But I didnʼt, I
knew that would piss him
off. I sometimes wonder if

that is at the root of his
distaste for me: Heʼs let me
see his shortcomings, and
he hates me for knowing
them.
He shoved me. Hard.
Two days ago, he shoved
me, and I fell and banged
my head against the
kitchen island and I
couldnʼt see for three
seconds. I donʼt really
know what to say about it.

It was more shocking than
painful. I was telling him I
could get a job, something
freelance, so we could
start a family, have a real
life …
“What do you call
this?” he said.
Purgatory, I thought. I
stayed silent.
“What do you call this,
Amy? Huh? What do you
call this? This isnʼt life,

according
to
Miss
Amazing?”
“Itʼs not my idea of
life,” I said, and he took
three big steps toward me,
and I thought: He looks like
heʼs going to … And then
he was slamming against
me and I was falling.
We both gasped. He
held his fist in the other
hand and looked like he
might cry. He was beyond

sorry, he was aghast. But
hereʼs the thing I want to
be clear on: I knew what I
was doing, I was punching
every button on him. I was
watching him coil tighter
and tighter—I wanted him
to finally say something,
do something. Even if itʼs
bad, even if itʼs the worst,
do something, Nick. Donʼt
leave me here like a ghost.
I just didnʼt realize he

was going to do that.
Iʼve never considered
what I would do if my
husband attacked me,
because I havenʼt exactly
run in the wife-beating
crowd. (I know, Lifetime
movie, I know: Violence
crosses all socioeconomic
barriers. But still: Nick?) I
sound glib. It just seems so
incredibly ludicrous: I am
a battered wife. Amazing

Amy and the Domestic
Abuser.
He
did
apologize
profusely. (Does anyone do
anything profusely except
apologize? Sweat, I guess.)
Heʼs agreed to consider
counseling, which was
something I never thought
could happen. Which is
good. Heʼs such a good
man, at his core, that I am
willing to write it off, to

believe it truly was a sick
anomaly, brought on by
the strain weʼre both
under. I forget sometimes,
that as much stress as I
feel, Nick feels it too: He
bears the burden of having
brought me here, he feels
the strain of wanting
mopey me to be content,
and for a man like Nick—
who believes strongly in
an
up-by-the-bootstraps

sort of happiness—that can
be infuriating.
So the hard shove, so
quick, then done, it didnʼt
scare me in itself. What
scared me was the look on
his face as I lay on the
floor blinking, my head
ringing. It was the look on
his face as he restrained
himself
from
taking
another jab. How much he
wanted to shove me again.

How hard it was not to.
How heʼs been looking at
me since: guilt, and disgust
at the guilt. Absolute
disgust.
Hereʼs the darkest part.
I drove out to the mall
yesterday, where about
half the town buys drugs,
and itʼs as easy as picking
up a prescription; I know
because Noelle told me:
Her husband goes there to

purchase the occasional
joint. I didnʼt want a joint,
though, I wanted a gun,
just in case. In case things
with Nick go really wrong.
I didnʼt realize until I was
almost there that it was
Valentineʼs Day. It was
Valentineʼs Day and I was
going to buy a gun and
then cook my husband
dinner. And I thought to
myself: Nickʼs dad was right

about you. You are a dumb
bitch. Because if you think
your husband is going to
hurt you, you leave. And yet
you canʼt leave your
husband, whoʼs mourning
his dead mother. You canʼt.
Youʼd have to be a biblically
awful woman to do that,
unless something were truly
wrong. Youʼd have to really
believe your husband was
going to hurt you.

But I donʼt really think
Nick would hurt me.
I just would feel safer
with a gun.

NICK DUNNE
SIX DAYS GONE

Go pushed me into the
car and peeled away from
the park. We flew past
Noelle, who was walking
with Boney and Gilpin
toward their cruiser, her
carefully dressed triplets

bumping along behind her
like kite ribbons. We
screeched past the mob:
hundreds of faces, a fleshy
pointillism of anger aimed
right at me. We ran away,
basically. Technically.
“Wow, ambush,” Go
muttered.
“Ambush?” I repeated,
brain-stunned.
“You think that was an
accident, Nick? Triplet

Cunt already made her
statement to the police.
Nothing
about
the
pregnancy.”
“Or theyʼre doling out
bombshells a little at a
time.”
Boney and Gilpin had
already heard my wife was
pregnant and decided to
make it a strategy. They
clearly really believed I
killed her.

“Noelle will be on
every cable broadcast for
the next week, talking
about how youʼre a
murderer and sheʼs Amyʼs
best friend out for justice.
Publicity whore. Publicity
fucking whore.”
I pressed my face
against
the
window,
slumped in my chair.
Several
news
vans
followed us. We drove

silently,
Goʼs
breath
slowing down. I watched
the river, a tree branch
bobbing its way south.
“Nick?” she finally said.
“Is it—uh … Do you—”
“I donʼt know, Go. Amy
didnʼt say anything to me.
If she was pregnant, why
would she tell Noelle and
not tell me?”
“Why would she try to
get a gun and not tell

you?” Go said. “None of
this makes sense.”
We retreated to Goʼs—
the camera crews would
be swarming my house—
and as soon as I walked in
the door my cell phone
rang, the real one. It was
the Elliotts. I sucked in
some air, ducked into my
old
bedroom,
then
answered.

“I need to ask you this,
Nick.” It was Rand, the TV
burbling
in
the
background. “I need you to
tell me. Did you know
Amy was pregnant?”
I paused, trying to find
the right way to phrase it,
the unlikelihood of a
pregnancy.
“Answer
me,
goddammit!”
Randʼs volume made

me get quieter. I spoke in a
soft, soothing voice, a
voice wearing a cardigan.
“Amy and I were not
trying to get pregnant. She
didnʼt
want
to
be
pregnant, Rand, I donʼt
know if she ever was going
to
be.
We
werenʼt
even … we werenʼt even
having relations that often.
Iʼd be … very surprised if
she was pregnant.”

“Noelle
said
Amy
visited the doctor to
confirm the pregnancy.
The
police
already
submitted a subpoena for
the records. Weʼll know
tonight.”
I found Go in the living
room, sitting with a cup of
cold coffee at my motherʼs
card table. She turned
toward me just enough to
show she knew I was

there, but she didnʼt let me
see her face.
“Why do you keep
lying, Nick?” she asked.
“The Elliotts are not your
enemy. Shouldnʼt you at
least tell them that it was
you who didnʼt want kids?
Why make Amy look like
the bad guy?”
I swallowed the rage
again. My stomach was hot
with it. “Iʼm exhausted,

Go. Goddamn. We gotta do
this now?”
“We gonna find a time
thatʼs better?”
“I did want kids. We
tried for a while, no luck.
We even started looking
into fertility treatments.
But then Amy decided she
didnʼt want kids.”
“You told me you
didnʼt.”
“I was trying to put a

good face on it.”
“Oh, awesome, another
lie,” Go said. “I didnʼt
realize you were such
a … What youʼre saying,
Nick, it makes no sense. I
was there, at the dinner to
celebrate The Bar, and
Mom misunderstood, she
thought you guys were
announcing that you were
pregnant, and it made
Amy cry.”

“Well, I canʼt explain
everything Amy ever did,
Go. I donʼt know why, a
fucking year ago, she cried
like that. Okay?”
Go sat quietly, the
orange of the streetlight
creating a rock-star halo
around her profile. “This is
going to be a real test for
you, Nick,” she murmured,
not looking at me. “Youʼve
always had trouble with

the truth—you always do
the little fib if you think it
will avoid a real argument.
Youʼve always gone the
easy way. Tell Mom you
went to baseball practice
when you really quit the
team; tell Mom you went
to church when you were
at a movie. Itʼs some weird
compulsion.”
“This is very different
from baseball, Go.”

“Itʼs a lot different. But
youʼre still fibbing like a
little boy. Youʼre still
desperate
to
have
everyone think youʼre
perfect. You never want to
be the bad guy. So you tell
Amyʼs parents she didnʼt
want kids. You donʼt tell
me youʼre cheating on
your wife. You swear the
credit cards in your name
arenʼt yours, you swear

you were hanging out at a
beach when you hate the
beach, you swear your
marriage was happy. I just
donʼt know what to
believe right now.”
“Youʼre kidding, right?”
“Since
Amy
has
disappeared, all youʼve
done is lie. It makes me
worry. About whatʼs going
on.”
Complete silence for a

moment.
“Go, are you saying
what I think youʼre
saying? Because if you are,
something has fucking
died between us.”
“Remember that game
you always played with
Mom when we were little:
Would you still love me if?
Would you still love me if I
smacked Go? Would you
still love me if I robbed a

bank? Would you still love
me if I killed someone?”
I said nothing. My
breath was coming too
fast.
“I would still love you,”
Go said.
“Go, do you really need
me to say it?”
She stayed silent.
“I did not kill Amy.”
She stayed silent.
“Do you believe me?” I

asked.
“I love you.”
She put her hand on
my shoulder and went to
her bedroom, shut the
door. I waited to see the
light go on in the room,
but it stayed dark.
Two seconds later, my
cell phone rang. This time,
it was the disposable cell
that I needed to get rid of
and couldnʼt because I

always, always, always
had to pick up for Andie.
Once a day, Nick. We need
to talk once a day.
I
realized
I
was
grinding my teeth.
I took a breath.
Far out on the edge of
town were the remains of
an Old West fort that was
now yet another park that
no one ever went to. All
that was left was the two-

story wooden watchtower,
surrounded
by
rusted
swing sets and teetertotters. Andie and I had
met there once, groping
each other inside the
shade of the watchtower.
I did three long loops
around town in my momʼs
old car to be sure I was not
tracked. It was madness to
go—it wasnʼt yet ten
oʼclock—but I had no say

in
our
rendezvous
anymore. I need to see you,
Nick, tonight, right now, or I
swear to you, I will lose it.
As I pulled up to the fort, I
was hit by the remoteness
of it and what it meant:
Andie was still willing to
meet me in a lonely, unlit
place, me the pregnantwife killer. As I walked
toward the tower through
the thick, scratchy grass, I

could just see her outline
in the tiny window of the
wooden watchtower.
She is going to undo you,
Nick. I quick-stepped the
rest of the way.
An hour later I was
huddled in my paparazziinfested house, waiting.
Rand said theyʼd know
before midnight whether
my wife was pregnant.
When the phone rang, I

grabbed it immediately
only to find it was
goddamn Comfort Hill. My
father was gone again. The
cops had been notified. As
always, they made it
sound as if I were the
jackass. If this happens
again, we are going to have
to terminate your fatherʼs
stay with us. I had a
sickening chill: My dad
moving in with me—two

pathetic, angry bastards—
it would surely make for
the worst buddy comedy
in the world. The ending
would be a murdersuicide. Ba-dum-dum! Cue
the laff track.
I was getting off the
phone, peering out the
back window at the river
—stay calm, Nick—when I
saw a huddled figure down
by the boathouse. I

thought it must be a stray
reporter, but then I
recognized something in
those balled fists and tight
shoulders. Comfort Hill
was about a thirty-minute
walk straight down River
Road.
He
somehow
remembered our house
when
he
couldnʼt
remember me.
I went outside into the
darkness to see him

dangling a foot over the
bank, staring into the
river. Less bedraggled than
before,
although
he
smelled tangy with sweat.
“Dad? What are you
doing here? Everyoneʼs
worried.”
He looked at me with
dark brown eyes, sharp
eyes, not the glazed-milk
color some elderly acquire.
It would have been less

disconcerting if theyʼd
been milky.
“She told me to come,”
he snapped. “She told me
to come. This is my house,
I can come whenever I
want.”
“You walked all the
way here?”
“I can come here
anytime. You may hate
me, but she loves me.” I
almost laughed. Even my

father was reinventing a
relationship with Amy.
A few photographers
on my front lawn began
shooting. I had to get my
dad back to the home. I
could picture the article
theyʼd have to cook up to
go
along
with
this
exclusive footage: What
kind of father was Bill
Dunne, what kind of man
did he raise? Good God, if

my dad started in on one
of his harangues against
the bitches … I dialed
Comfort Hill, and after
some finagling, they sent
an orderly to retrieve him.
I made a display of
walking him gently to the
sedan,
murmuring
reassuringly
as
the
photographers got their
shots.
My dad. I smiled as he

left. I tried to make it seem
very
proud-son.
The
reporters asked me if I
killed my wife. I was
retreating to the house
when a cop car pulled up.
It was Boney who came
to my home, braving the
paparazzi, to tell me. She
did it kindly, in a gentlefingertip voice.
Amy was pregnant.
My wife was gone with

my baby inside her. Boney
watched me, waiting for
my reaction—make it part
of the police report—so I
told myself, Act correctly,
donʼt blow it, act the way a
man acts when he hears this
news. I ducked my head
into
my
hands
and
muttered, Oh God, oh God,
and while I was doing it, I
saw my wife on the floor
of our kitchen, her hands

around her belly and her
head bashed in.

DIARY ENTRY

I have never felt more
alive in my life. It is a
bright, blue-sky day, the

birds are lunatic with the
warmth, the river outside
is gushing past, and I am
utterly
alive.
Scared,
thrilled, but alive.
This morning when I
woke up, Nick was gone. I
sat in bed staring at the
ceiling, watching the sun
golden it a foot at a time,
the bluebirds singing right
outside our window, and I
wanted to vomit. My

throat was clenching and
unclenching like a heart. I
told myself I would not
throw up, then I ran to the
bathroom and threw up:
bile and warm water and
one small bobbing pea. As
my stomach was seizing
and my eyes were tearing
and I was gasping for
breath, I started doing the
only kind of math a
woman does, huddled over

a toilet. Iʼm on the pill, but
Iʼd also forgotten a day or
two—what does it matter,
Iʼm thirty-eight, Iʼve been
on the pill for almost two
decades. Iʼm not going to
accidentally get pregnant.
I found the tests behind
a locked sheet of glass. I
had to track down a
harried, mustached woman
to unlock the case, and
point out one I wanted

while
she
waited
impatiently. She handed it
to me with a clinical stare
and said, “Good luck.”
I didnʼt know what
would be good luck: plus
sign or minus sign. I drove
home
and
read
the
directions three times, and
I held the stick at the right
angle for the right number
of seconds, and then I set
it on the edge of the sink

and ran away like it was a
bomb. Three minutes, so I
turned on the radio and of
course it was a Tom Petty
song—is there ever a time
you turn on the radio and
donʼt hear a Tom Petty
song?—so I sang every
word to “American Girl”
and then I crept back into
the bathroom like the test
was something I had to
sneak up on, my heart

beating more frantically
than it should, and I was
pregnant.
I was suddenly running
across the summer lawn
and down the street,
banging on Noelleʼs door,
and when she opened it, I
burst into tears and
showed her the stick and
yelled, “Iʼm pregnant!”
And then someone else
besides me knew, and so I

was scared.
Once I got back home, I
had two thoughts.
One: Our anniversary is
coming next week. I will
use the clues as love
letters, a beautiful antique
wooden cradle waiting at
the end. I will convince
him we belong together.
As a family.
Two: I wish Iʼd been
able to get that gun.

I get frightened now,
sometimes,
when
my
husband gets home. A few
weeks ago, Nick asked me
to go out on the raft with
him, float along in the
current under a blue sky. I
actually
wrapped
my
hands around our newel
post when he asked me
this, I clung to it. Because I
had an image of him
wobbling the raft—teasing

at first, laughing at my
panic, and then his face
going tight, determined,
and me falling into the
water, that muddy brown
water, scratchy with sticks
and sand, and him on top
of me, holding me under
with one strong arm, until
I stopped struggling.
I canʼt help it. Nick
married me when I was a
young,
rich,
beautiful

woman, and now I am
poor, jobless, closer to
forty than thirty; Iʼm not
just pretty anymore, I am
pretty for my age. It is the
truth: My value has
decreased. I can tell by the
way Nick looks at me. But
itʼs not the look of a guy
who took a tumble on an
honest bet. Itʼs the look of
a man who feels swindled.
Soon it may be the look of

a man who is trapped. He
might have been able to
divorce me before the
baby. But he would never
do that now, not Good Guy
Nick. He couldnʼt bear to
have everyone in this
family-values town believe
heʼs the kind of guy whoʼd
abandon his wife and
child. Heʼd rather stay and
suffer with me. Suffer and
resent and rage.

I
wonʼt
have
an
abortion. The baby is six
weeks in my belly today,
the size of a lentil, and is
growing eyes and lungs
and ears. A few hours ago,
I went into the kitchen and
found a snap-top container
of dried beans Maureen
had given me for Nickʼs
favorite soup, and I pulled
out a lentil and laid it on
the counter. It was smaller

than my pinkie nail, tiny. I
couldnʼt bear to leave it on
the cold countertop, so I
picked it up and held it in
my palm and petted it
with the tip-tip-tip of a
finger. Now itʼs in the
pocket of my T-shirt, so I
can keep it close.
I wonʼt get an abortion
and I wonʼt divorce Nick,
not yet, because I can still
remember how heʼd dive

into the ocean on a
summer day and stand on
his hands, his legs flailing
out of the water, and leap
back up with the best
seashell just for me, and
Iʼd let my eyes get dazzled
by the sun, and Iʼd shut
them and see the colors
blinking like raindrops on
the inside of my eyelids as
Nick kissed me with salty
lips and Iʼd think, I am so

lucky, this is my husband,
this man will be the father of
my children. Weʼll all be so
happy.
But I may be wrong, I
may be very wrong.
Because sometimes, the
way he looks at me? That
sweet boy from the beach,
man of my dreams, father
of my child? I catch him
looking at me with those
watchful eyes, the eyes of

an insect, pure calculation,
and I think: This man might
kill me.
So if you find this and
Iʼm dead, well …
Sorry, thatʼs not funny.

NICK DUNNE
SEVEN DAYS
GONE

It was time. At exactly
eight A.M. Central, nine
A.M. New York time, I
picked up my phone. My
wife
was
definitely
pregnant. I was definitely

the prime—only—suspect.
I was going to get a
lawyer, today, and he was
going to be the very
lawyer I didnʼt want and
absolutely needed.
Tanner Bolt. A grim
necessity. Flip around any
of the legal networks, the
true-crime shows, and
Tanner Boltʼs spray-tanned
face would pop up,
indignant and concerned

on behalf of whatever
freak-show client he was
representing. He became
famous at thirty-four for
representing Cody Olsen, a
Chicago
restaurateur
accused of strangling his
very pregnant wife and
dumping her body in a
landfill.
Corpse
dogs
detected the scent of a
dead body inside the trunk
of Codyʼs Mercedes; a

search of his laptop
revealed that someone had
printed out a map to the
nearest
landfill
the
morning Codyʼs wife went
missing. A no-brainer. By
the time Tanner Bolt was
done,
everyone—the
police department, two
West Side Chicago gang
members, a disgruntled
club
bouncer—was
implicated except Cody

Olsen, who walked out of
the courtroom and bought
cocktails all around.
In the decade since,
Tanner Bolt had become
known as the Hubby Hawk
—his
specialty
was
swooping down in highprofile cases to represent
men accused of murdering
their wives. He was
successful over half the
time, which wasnʼt bad,

considering the cases were
usually
damning,
the
accused
extremely
unlikable—cheaters,
narcissists,
sociopaths.
Tanner
Boltʼs
other
nickname was Dickhead
Defender.
I had a two P.M.
appointment.
“This
is
Marybeth
Elliott. Please leave a
message, and I will return

promptly …” she said in a
voice just like Amyʼs.
Amy, who would not
return promptly.
I was speeding to the
airport to fly to New York
and meet with Tanner
Bolt. When Iʼd asked
Boneyʼs permission to
leave town, she seemed
amused: Cops donʼt really
do that. Thatʼs just on TV.
“Hi, Marybeth, itʼs Nick

again. Iʼm anxious to talk
to you. I wanted to tell
you … uh, I truly didnʼt
know
about
the
pregnancy, Iʼm just as
shocked as you must
be … uh, also Iʼm hiring
an attorney, just so you
know. I think even Rand
had suggested it. So
anyway … you know how
bad I am on messages. I
hope you call me back.”

Tanner Boltʼs office
was in midtown, not far
from where I used to work.
The elevator shot me up
twenty-five stories, but it
was so smooth that I
wasnʼt sure I was moving
until my ears popped. At
the twenty-sixth floor, a
tight-lipped blonde in a
sleek business suit stepped
on. She tapped her foot
impatiently, waiting for

the doors to shut, then
snapped at me, “Why donʼt
you hit close?” I flashed
her the smile I give
petulant
women,
the
lighten-up smile, the one
Amy called the “beloved
Nicky grin,” and then the
woman recognized me.
“Oh,” she said. She looked
as
if
she
smelled
something rancid. She
seemed
personally

vindicated when I scuttled
out on Tannerʼs floor.
This guy was the best,
and I needed the best, but
I also resented being
associated with him in any
way—this sleazebag, this
showboat, this attorney to
the guilty. I pre-hated
Tanner Bolt so much that I
expected his office to look
like a Miami Vice set. But
Bolt & Bolt was quite the

opposite—it was dignified,
lawyerly. Behind spotless
glass doors, people in very
good
suits
commuted
busily between offices.
A young, pretty man
with a tie the color of
tropical fruit greeted me
and settled me down in the
shiny
glass-and-mirror
reception area and grandly
offered water (declined),
then went back to a

gleaming desk and picked
up a gleaming phone. I sat
on the sofa, watching the
skyline, cranes pecking up
and down like mechanical
birds. Then I unfolded
Amyʼs final clue from my
pocket. Five years is wood.
Was that going to be the
end prize of the treasure
hunt? Something for the
baby: a carved oak cradle,
a
wooden
rattle?

Something for our baby
and for us, to start over,
the Dunnes redone.
Go phoned while I was
still staring at the clue.
“Are we okay?” she
asked immediately.
My sister thought I was
possibly a wife killer.
“Weʼre as okay as I
think we can ever be
again, considering.”
“Nick. Iʼm sorry. I

called to say Iʼm sorry,” Go
said. “I woke up and felt
totally insane. And awful. I
lost my head. It was a
momentary freakout. I
really, truly apologize.”
I remained silent.
“You got to give me
this, Nick: exhaustion and
stress
and
…
Iʼm
sorry … truly.”
“Okay,” I lied.
“But Iʼm glad, actually.

It cleared the air—”
“She was definitely
pregnant.”
My stomach turned.
Again I felt as if I had
forgotten
something
crucial. I had overlooked
something and would pay
for it.
“Iʼm sorry,” Go said.
She waited a few seconds.
“The fact of the matter is
—”

“I canʼt talk about it. I
canʼt.”
“Okay.”
“Iʼm actually in New
York,” I said. “I have an
appointment with Tanner
Bolt.”
She let out a whoosh of
breath.
“Thank God. You were
able to see him that
quick?”
“Thatʼs how fucked my

case is.” Iʼd been patched
through at once to Tanner
—I was on hold all of
three seconds after stating
my name—and when I told
him about my living-room
interrogation, about the
pregnancy, he ordered me
to hop the next plane.
“Iʼm kinda freaking
out,” I added.
“Youʼre
doing
the
smart thing. Seriously.”

Another pause.
“His name canʼt really
be Tanner Bolt, can it?” I
said, trying to make light.
“I
heard
itʼs
an
anagram for Ratner Tolb.”
“Really?”
“No.”
I
laughed,
an
inappropriate feeling, but
good. Then, from the far
side of the room, the
anagram
was
walking

toward me—black pinstriped suit and lime-green
tie, sharky grin. He walked
with his hand out, in
shake-and-strike mode.
“Nick
Dunne,
Iʼm
Tanner Bolt. Come with
me, letʼs get to work.”
Tanner Boltʼs office
seemed
designed
to
resemble the clubroom of
an exclusive all-menʼs golf
course—comfortable

leather chairs, shelves
thick with legal books, a
gas fireplace with flames
flickering in the airconditioning. Sit down,
have a cigar, complain
about the wife, tell some
questionable jokes, just us
guys here.
Bolt deliberately chose
not to sit behind his desk.
He ushered me toward a
two-man table as if we

were going to play chess.
This is a conversation for us
partners, Bolt said without
having to say it. Weʼll sit at
our little war-room table and
get down to it.
“My
retainer,
Mr.
Dunne, is a hundred
thousand dollars. Thatʼs a
lot of money, obviously. So
I want to be clear on what
I offer and on what I will
expect of you, okay?”

He aimed unblinking
eyes at me, a sympathetic
smile, and waited for me
to nod. Only Tanner Bolt
could get away with
making me, a client, fly to
him, then tell me what
kind of dance Iʼd need to
do in order to give him my
money.
“I win, Mr. Dunne. I
win unwinnable cases, and
the case that I think you

may soon face is—I donʼt
want to patronize you—
itʼs a tough one. Money
troubles, bumpy marriage,
pregnant wife. The media
has turned on you, the
public has turned on you.”
He twisted a signet ring
on his right hand and
waited for me to show him
I was listening. Iʼd always
heard the phrase: At forty,
a man wears the face heʼs

earned. Boltʼs fortyish face
was well tended, almost
wrinkle-free,
pleasantly
plump with ego. Here was
a confident man, the best
in his field, a man who
liked his life.
“There will be no more
police interviews without
my presence,” Bolt was
saying. “Thatʼs something I
seriously regret you did.
But before we even get to

the legal portion, we need
to start dealing with public
opinion, because the way
itʼs going, we have to
assume everything is going
to get leaked: your credit
cards, the life insurance,
the supposedly staged
crime scene, the moppedup blood. It looks very
bad, my friend. And so itʼs
a vicious cycle: The cops
think you did it, they let

the public know. The
public is outraged, they
demand an arrest. So, one:
Weʼve got to find an
alternative suspect. Two:
Weʼve got to keep the
support of Amyʼs parents, I
cannot emphasize that
piece enough. And three:
Weʼve got to fix your
image, because should this
go to trial, it will influence
the juror pool. Change of

venue
doesnʼt
mean
anything
anymore—
twenty-four-hour
cable,
Internet, the whole world
is your venue. So I cannot
tell you how key it is to
start turning this whole
thing around.”
“Iʼd like that too,
believe me.”
“How are things with
Amyʼs parents? Can we get
them to make a statement

of support?”
“I havenʼt spoken with
them
since
it
was
confirmed that Amy was
pregnant.”
“Is pregnant.” Tanner
frowned at me. “Is. She is
pregnant.
Never,
ever
mention your wife in the
past tense.”
“Fuck.” I put my face in
my palm for a second. I
hadnʼt even noticed what

Iʼd said.
“Donʼt worry about it
with me,” Bolt said,
waving
the
air
magnanimously.
“But
everywhere else, worry.
Worry hard. From now on,
I donʼt want you to open
your mouth if you havenʼt
thought it through. So you
havenʼt spoken to Amyʼs
parents. I donʼt like that.
Youʼve tried to get in

touch, I assume?”
“Iʼve
left
a
few
messages.”
Bolt
scrawled
something on a yellow
legal pad. “Okay, we have
to assume this is bad news
for us. But you need to
track them down. Nowhere
public,
where
some
asshole
with
a
cameraphone can film you
—we canʼt have another

Shawna Kelly moment. Or
send your sister in, a recon
mission, see whatʼs going
on. Actually, do that,
thatʼs better.”
“Okay.”
“I need you to make a
list for me, Nick. Of all the
nice things youʼve done
for Amy over the years.
Romantic
things,
especially in this past year.
You cooked her chicken

soup when she was sick, or
you sent her love letters
while you were on a
business trip. Nothing too
flashy. I donʼt care about
jewelry unless you guys
picked it out on vacation
or something. We need
real personal stuff here,
romantic-movie stuff.”
“What if Iʼm not a
romantic-movie kind of
guy?”

Tanner tightened his
lips, then blew them back
out. “Come up with
something, okay, Nick?
You seem like a good guy.
Iʼm
sure
you
did
something thoughtful this
past year.”
I couldnʼt think of a
decent thing Iʼd done in
the past two years. In New
York, those first few years
of marriage, Iʼd been

desperate to please my
wife, to return to those
loose-limbed days when
sheʼd
run
across
a
drugstore parking lot and
leap into my arms, a
spontaneous celebration of
her hair-spray purchase.
Her face pressed up
against mine all the time,
her bright blue eyes wide
and her yellow lashes
catching on mine, the heat

of her breath just under
my nose, the silliness of it.
For two years I tried as my
old wife slipped away, and
I tried so hard—no anger,
no arguments, the constant
kowtowing,
the
capitulation, the sitcomhusband version of me:
Yes, dear. Of course,
sweetheart. The fucking
energy leached from my
body as my frantic-rabbit

thoughts tried to figure out
how to make her happy,
and each action, each
attempt, was met with a
rolled eye or a sad little
sigh. A you just donʼt get it
sigh.
By the time we left for
Missouri, I was just pissed.
I was ashamed of the
memory
of
me—the
scuttling,
scraping,
hunchbacked toadie of a

man Iʼd turned into. So I
wasnʼt romantic; I wasnʼt
even nice.
“Also, I need a list of
people who may have
harmed Amy, who may
have
had
something
against her.”
“I should tell you, it
seems Amy tried to buy a
gun earlier this year.”
“The cops know?”
“Yes.”

“Did you know?”
“Not until the guy she
tried to buy from told me.”
He took exactly two
seconds to think. “Then I
bet their theory is she
wanted a gun to protect
herself from you,” he said.
“She was isolated, she was
scared. She wanted to
believe in you, yet she
could feel something was
very wrong, so she wanted

a gun in case her worst
fear was correct.”
“Wow, youʼre good.”
“My dad was a cop,” he
said. “But I do like the gun
idea—now we just need
someone to match it to
besides you. Nothing is too
far out. If she argued with
a neighbor constantly over
a barking dog, if she was
forced to rebuff a flirty
guy, whatever you got, I

need. What do you know
about Tommy OʼHara?”
“Right! I know he
called the tip line a few
times.”
“He was accused of
date-raping Amy in 2005.”
I felt my mouth open,
but I said nothing.
“She was dating him
casually. There was a
dinner date at his place,
things got out of hand, and

he raped her, according to
my sources.”
“When in 2005?”
“May.”
It was during the eight
months when Iʼd lost Amy
—the time between our
New Yearʼs meeting and
my finding her again on
Seventh Avenue.
Tanner tightened his
tie, twisted a diamondstudded wedding band,

assessing me. “She never
told you.”
“I havenʼt heard a
single thing about this,” I
said. “From anyone. But
especially not from Amy.”
“Youʼd be surprised,
the number of women who
still find it a stigma.
Ashamed.”
“I canʼt believe I—”
“I try never to show up
to one of these meetings

without new information
for my client,” he said. “I
want to show you how
serious I am about your
case. And how much you
need me.”
“This guy could be a
suspect?”
“Sure,
why
not,”
Tanner said too breezily.
“He has a violent history
with your wife.”
“Did he go to prison?”

“She
dropped
the
charges. Didnʼt want to
testify, I assume. If you
and I decide to work
together, Iʼll have him
checked out. In the
meantime, think of anyone
who took an interest in
your wife. Better if itʼs
someone
in
Carthage,
though. More believable.
Now—” Tanner crossed a
leg, exposed his bottom

row
of
teeth,
uncomfortably
bunched
and stained in comparison
with his perfect picketfence top row. He held his
crooked teeth against his
upper lip for a moment.
“Now comes the harder
part, Nick,” he said. “I
need total honesty from
you, it wonʼt work any
other way. So tell me
everything about your

marriage, tell me the
worst. Because if I know
the worst, then I can plan
for it. But if Iʼm surprised,
weʼre fucked. And if weʼre
fucked, youʼre fucked.
Because I get to fly away
in my G4.”
I took a breath. Looked
him in the eyes. “I cheated
on
Amy.
Iʼve
been
cheating on Amy.”
“Okay. With multiple

women or just one?”
“No, not multiple. Iʼve
never cheated before.”
“So, with one woman?”
Bolt asked, and looked
away, his eyes resting on a
watercolor of a sailboat as
he twirled his wedding
band. I could picture him
phoning his wife later,
saying, Just once, just once,
I want a guy whoʼs not an
asshole.

“Yes, just one girl, sheʼs
very—”
“Donʼt say girl, donʼt
ever say girl,” Bolt said.
“Woman. One woman who
is very special to you. Is
that what you were going
to say?”
Of course it was.
“You do know, Nick,
special is actually worse
than—okay. How long?”
“A little over a year.”

“Have you spoken to
her since Amy went
missing?”
“Yes, on a disposable
cell phone. And in person
once. Twice. But—”
“In person.”
“No one has seen us. I
can swear to that. Just my
sister.”
He took a breath,
looked at the sailboat
again. “And what does this

—Whatʼs her name?”
“Andie.”
“What is her attitude
about all this?”
“Sheʼs been great—
until
the
pregnancy … announcemen
Now I think sheʼs a
little … on edge. Very on
edge. Very, uh … needy is
the wrong word …”
“Say what you need to
say, Nick. If sheʼs needy,

then—”
“Sheʼs needy. Clingy.
Needs lots of reassurance.
Sheʼs a really sweet girl,
but sheʼs young, and itʼs,
itʼs been hard, obviously.”
Tanner Bolt went to his
minibar and pulled out a
Clamato. The entire fridge
was filled with Clamato.
He opened the bottle and
drank it in three swallows,
then dabbed his lips with a

cloth napkin. “You will
need to cut off, completely
and forever, all contact
with Andie,” he said. I
began to speak, and he
aimed a palm at me.
“Immediately.”
“I canʼt cut it off with
her just like that. Out of
nowhere.”
“This isnʼt something to
debate. Nick. I mean, come
on, buddy, I really got to

say this? You cannot date
around
while
your
pregnant wife is missing.
You will go to fucking
prison. Now, the issue is to
do it without turning her
against us. Without leaving
her with a vendetta, an
urge to go public, anything
but fond memories. Make
her believe that this was
the decent thing, make her
want to keep you safe.

How are you at breakups?”
I opened my mouth,
but he didnʼt wait.
“Weʼll prep you for the
conversation the same way
weʼd prep you for a crossexam, okay? Now, if you
want me, Iʼll fly to
Missouri, Iʼll set up camp,
and we can really get to
work on this. I can be with
you as soon as tomorrow if
you want me for your

lawyer. Do you?”
“I do.”
I was back in Carthage
before dinnertime. It was
strange,
once
Tanner
swept Andie from the
picture—once it became
clear that she simply
couldnʼt
stay—how
quickly I accepted it, how
little I mourned her. On
that
single,
two-hour
flight, I transitioned from

in love with Andie to not in
love with Andie. Like
walking through a door.
Our
relationship
immediately attained a
sepia tone: the past. How
odd, that I ruined my
marriage over that little
girl with whom I had
nothing in common except
that we both liked a good
laugh and a cold beer after
sex.

Of course youʼre fine
with ending it, Go would
say. It got hard.
But there was a better
reason: Amy was blooming
large in my mind. She was
gone, and yet she was
more present than anyone
else. Iʼd fallen in love with
Amy because I was the
ultimate Nick with her.
Loving her made me
superhuman, it made me

feel alive. At her easiest,
she was hard, because her
brain was always working,
working, working—I had
to exert myself just to keep
pace with her. Iʼd spend an
hour crafting a casual email to her, I became a
student of arcana so I
could keep her interested:
the Lake poets, the code
duello,
the
French
Revolution. Her mind was

both wide and deep, and I
got smarter being with
her. And more considerate,
and more active, and more
alive, and almost electric,
because for Amy, love was
like drugs or booze or
porn: There was no
plateau. Each exposure
needed to be more intense
than the last to achieve the
same result.
Amy made me believe I

was exceptional, that I was
up to her level of play.
That was both our making
and undoing. Because I
couldnʼt
handle
the
demands of greatness. I
began craving ease and
average-ness, and I hated
myself
for
it,
and
ultimately, I realized, I
punished her for it. I
turned her into the brittle,
prickly thing she became. I

had pretended to be one
kind of man and revealed
myself to be quite another.
Worse, I convinced myself
our tragedy was entirely
her making. I spent years
working myself into the
very thing I swore she was:
a righteous ball of hate.
On the flight home, Iʼd
looked at Clue 4 for so
long, Iʼd memorized it. I

wanted to torture myself.
No wonder her notes were
so different this time: My
wife was pregnant, she
wanted to start over,
return us to our dazzling,
happy aliveness. I could
picture her running around
town to hide those sweet
notes, eager as a schoolgirl
for me to get to the end—
the announcement that she
was pregnant with my

child. Wood. It had to be
an old-fashioned cradle. I
knew my wife: It had to be
an
antique
cradle.
Although the clue wasnʼt
quite in an expectantmother tone.
Picture me: Iʼm a
girl who is very bad
I need to be
punished,
and
by
punished, I mean had
Itʼs where you

store
goodies
for
anniversary five
Pardon me if this
is getting contrived!
A good time was
had here right at sunny
midday
Then out for a
cocktail, all so terribly
gay.
So run there right
now, full of sweet sighs,
And open the

door for your big
surprise.
I was almost home
when I figured it out. Store
goodies for anniversary five:
Goodies
would
be
something made of wood.
To punish is to take
someone to the woodshed.
It was the woodshed
behind my sisterʼs house—
a place to stow lawnmower parts and rusty

tools—a
decrepit
old
outbuilding,
like
something from a slasher
movie where campers are
slowly killed off. Go never
went back there; sheʼd
often joked of burning it
down since she moved into
the house. Instead, sheʼd
let it get even more
overgrown
and
cobwebbed. Weʼd always
joked that it would be a

good place to bury a body.
It couldnʼt be.
I drove across town,
my face numb, my hands
cold. Goʼs car was in the
driveway, but I slipped
past the glowing livingroom window and down
the steep downhill slope,
and I was soon out of her
sight range, out of sight of
anyone. Very private.
Back to the far back of

the yard, on the edge of
the tree line, there was the
shed.
I opened the door.
Nonononono.

BOY

ELLIOTT
DUNNE
THE DAY OF

Iʼm so much happier
now that Iʼm dead.
Technically,
missing.
Soon to be presumed dead.

But as shorthand, weʼll say
dead. Itʼs been only a
matter of hours, but I feel
better already: loose joints,
wavy muscles. At one
point this morning, I
realized my face felt
strange, different. I looked
in the rearview mirror—
dread Carthage forty-three
miles behind me, my smug
husband lounging around
his sticky bar as mayhem

dangled on a thin piano
wire just above his shitty,
oblivious head—and I
realized I was smiling. Ha!
Thatʼs new.
My checklist for today
—one of many checklists
Iʼve made over the past
year—sits beside me in the
passenger seat, a spot of
blood right next to Item
22: Cut myself. But Amy is
afraid of blood, the diary

readers will say. (The
diary, yes! Weʼll get to my
brilliant diary.) No, Iʼm
not, not a bit, but for the
past year Iʼve been saying
I am. I told Nick probably
half a dozen times how
afraid I am of blood, and
when he said, “I donʼt
remember you being so
afraid of blood,” I replied,
“Iʼve told you, Iʼve told
you so many times!” Nick

has
such
a
careless
memory for other peopleʼs
problems, he just assumed
it was true. Swooning at
the plasma center, that
was a nice touch. I really
did that, I didnʼt just write
that I did. (Donʼt fret,
weʼll sort this out: the true
and the not true and the
might as well be true.)
Item 22, Cut myself,
has been on the list a long

time. Now itʼs real, and
my arm hurts. A lot. It
takes a very special
discipline to slice oneself
past the paper-cut layer,
down to the muscle. You
want a lot of blood, but
not so much that you pass
out, get discovered hours
later in a kiddie pool of
red with a lot of explaining
to do. I held a box cutter
to my wrist first, but

looking at that crisscross
of veins, I felt like a bomb
technician in an action
movie: Snip the wrong line
and you die. I ended up
cutting into the inside of
my upper arm, gnawing on
a rag so I wouldnʼt scream.
One long, deep good one. I
sat cross-legged on my
kitchen floor for ten
minutes, letting the blood
drizzle steadily until Iʼd

made a nice thick puddle.
Then I cleaned it up as
poorly as Nick would have
done after he bashed my
head in. I want the house
to tell a story of conflict
between true and false.
The living room looks
staged, yet the blood has
been cleaned up: It canʼt be
Amy!
So the self-mutilation
was worth it. Still, hours

later, the slice burns under
my sleeves, under the
tourniquet.
(Item
30:
Carefully dress wound,
ensuring no blood has
dripped where it shouldnʼt
be present. Wrap box
cutter and tuck away in
pocket for later disposal.)
Item 18: Stage the
living room. Tip ottoman.
Check.
Item 12: Wrap the first

clue in its box and tuck it
just out of the way so the
police will find it before
dazed husband thinks to
look for it. It has to be part
of the police record. I want
him to be forced to start
the treasure hunt (his ego
will make him finish it).
Check.
Item 32: Change into
generic clothes, tuck hair
in hat, climb down the

banks of the river, and
scuttle along the edge, the
water
lapping
inches
below, until you reach the
edge of the complex. Do
this even though you know
the Teverers, the only
neighbors with a view of
the river, will be at
church. Do this because
you never know. You
always take the extra step
that others donʼt, thatʼs

who you are.
Item 29: Say goodbye
to Bleecker. Smell his little
stinky cat breath one last
time. Fill his kibble dish in
case people forget to feed
him once everything starts.
Item 33: Get the fuck
out of Dodge.
Check, check, check.
I can tell you more
about
how
I
did
everything, but Iʼd like

you to know me first. Not
Diary Amy, who is a work
of fiction (and Nick said I
wasnʼt really a writer, and
why did I ever listen to
him?), but me, Actual
Amy. What kind of woman
would do such a thing? Let
me tell you a story, a true
story, so you can begin to
understand.
To start: I should never
have been born.

My mother had five
miscarriages
and
two
stillbirths before me.
One a year, in the fall,
as if it were a seasonal
duty, like crop rotation.
They were all girls; they
were all named Hope. Iʼm
sure it was my fatherʼs
suggestion—his optimistic
impulse,
his
tie-dyed
earnestness: We canʼt give
up hope, Marybeth. But give

up Hope is exactly what
they did, over and over
again.
The doctors ordered my
parents to stop trying; they
refused. They are not
quitters. They tried and
tried, and finally came me.
My mother didnʼt count on
my being alive, couldnʼt
bear to think of me as an
actual baby, a living child,
a girl who would get to

come home. I would have
been Hope 8, if things had
gone badly. But I entered
the world hollering—an
electric, neon pink. My
parents were so surprised,
they realized theyʼd never
discussed a name, not a
real one, for a real child.
For my first two days in
the hospital, they didnʼt
name me. Each morning
my mother would hear the

door to her room open and
feel the nurse lingering in
the doorway (I always
pictured her vintage, with
swaying white skirts and
one of those folded caps
like a Chinese take-out
box). The nurse would
linger, and my mother
would ask without even
looking up, “Is she still
alive?”
When I remained alive,

they named me Amy,
because it was a regular
girlʼs name, a popular
girlʼs name, a name a
thousand other baby girls
were given that year, so
maybe the gods wouldnʼt
notice this little baby
nestled among the others.
Marybeth said if she were
to do it again, sheʼd name
me Lydia.
I grew up feeling

special, proud. I was the
girl who battled oblivion
and won. The chances
were about 1 percent, but I
did it. I ruined my
motherʼs womb in the
process—my own prenatal
Shermanʼs
March.
Marybeth would never
have another baby. As a
child, I got a vibrant
pleasure out of this: just
me, just me, only me.

My mother would sip
hot tea on the days of the
Hopesʼ birth-deaths, sit in
a rocker with a blanket,
and say she was just
“taking a little time for
myself.” Nothing dramatic,
my mother is too sensible
to sing dirges, but she
would get pensive, she
would remove herself, and
I would have none of it,
needful thing that I was. I

would clamber onto my
motherʼs lap, or thrust a
crayoned drawing in her
face, or remember a
permission
slip
that
needed prompt attention.
My father would try to
distract me, try to take me
to a movie or bribe me
with sweets. No matter the
ruse, it didnʼt work. I
wouldnʼt give my mother
those few minutes.

Iʼve always been better
than the Hopes, I was the
one who made it.
But Iʼve always been
jealous too, always—seven
dead dancing princesses.
They get to be perfect
without
even
trying,
without even facing one
moment
of
existence,
while I am stuck here on
earth, and every day I
must try, and every day is

a chance to be less than
perfect.
Itʼs an exhausting way
to live. I lived that way
until I was thirty-one.
And then, for about
two years, everything was
okay. Because of Nick.
Nick loved me. A six-o
kind of love: He looooooved
me. But he didnʼt love me,
me. Nick loved a girl who
doesnʼt
exist.
I
was

pretending, the way I often
did, pretending to have a
personality. I canʼt help it,
itʼs what Iʼve always done:
The way some women
change fashion regularly, I
change personalities. What
persona feels good, whatʼs
coveted,
whatʼs
au
courant? I think most
people do this, they just
donʼt admit it, or else they
settle on one persona

because theyʼre too lazy or
stupid to pull off a switch.
That night at the
Brooklyn party, I was
playing the girl who was
in style, the girl a man like
Nick wants: the Cool Girl.
Men always say that as the
defining
compliment,
donʼt they? Sheʼs a cool
girl. Being the Cool Girl
means I am a hot, brilliant,
funny woman who adores

football, poker, dirty jokes,
and burping, who plays
video games, drinks cheap
beer, loves threesomes and
anal sex, and jams hot
dogs and hamburgers into
her mouth like sheʼs
hosting the worldʼs biggest
culinary gang bang while
somehow maintaining a
size 2, because Cool Girls
are above all hot. Hot and
understanding. Cool Girls

never get angry; they only
smile in a chagrined,
loving manner and let
their men do whatever
they want. Go ahead, shit
on me, I donʼt mind, Iʼm the
Cool Girl.
Men actually think this
girl exists. Maybe theyʼre
fooled because so many
women are willing to
pretend to be this girl. For
a long time Cool Girl

offended me. I used to see
men—friends, coworkers,
strangers—giddy
over
these
awful
pretender
women, and Iʼd want to sit
these men down and
calmly say: You are not
dating a woman, you are
dating a woman who has
watched too many movies
written by socially awkward
men whoʼd like to believe
that this kind of woman

exists and might kiss them.
Iʼd want to grab the poor
guy by his lapels or
messenger bag and say:
The bitch doesnʼt really love
chili dogs that much—no
one loves chili dogs that
much! And the Cool Girls
are even more pathetic:
Theyʼre
not
even
pretending to be the
woman they want to be,
theyʼre pretending to be

the woman a man wants
them to be. Oh, and if
youʼre not a Cool Girl, I
beg you not to believe that
your man doesnʼt want the
Cool Girl. It may be a
slightly different version—
maybe heʼs a vegetarian,
so Cool Girl loves seitan
and is great with dogs; or
maybe heʼs a hipster artist,
so Cool Girl is a tattooed,
bespectacled nerd who

loves comics. There are
variations to the window
dressing, but believe me,
he wants Cool Girl, who is
basically the girl who likes
every fucking thing he
likes and doesnʼt ever
complain. (How do you
know youʼre not Cool Girl?
Because he says things
like: “I like strong women.”
If he says that to you, he
will at some point fuck

someone else. Because “I
like strong women” is code
for
“I
hate
strong
women.”)
I waited patiently—
years—for the pendulum to
swing the other way, for
men to start reading Jane
Austen, learn how to knit,
pretend to love cosmos,
organize
scrapbook
parties, and make out with
each other while we leer.

And then weʼd say, Yeah,
heʼs a Cool Guy.
But it never happened.
Instead, women across the
nation colluded in our
degradation! Pretty soon
Cool Girl became the
standard
girl.
Men
believed she existed—she
wasnʼt just a dreamgirl
one in a million. Every girl
was supposed to be this
girl, and if you werenʼt,

then there was something
wrong with you.
But itʼs tempting to be
Cool Girl. For someone
like me, who likes to win,
itʼs tempting to want to be
the girl every guy wants.
When I met Nick, I knew
immediately that was what
he wanted, and for him, I
guess I was willing to try. I
will accept my portion of
blame. The thing is, I was

crazy about him at first. I
found
him
perversely
exotic, a good ole Missouri
boy. He was so damn nice
to be around. He teased
things out in me that I
didnʼt know existed: a
lightness, a humor, an
ease. It was as if he
hollowed me out and filled
me with feathers. He
helped me be Cool Girl—I
couldnʼt have been Cool

Girl with anyone else. I
wouldnʼt have wanted to. I
canʼt say I didnʼt enjoy
some of it: I ate a
MoonPie,
I
walked
barefoot,
I
stopped
worrying. I watched dumb
movies and ate chemically
laced foods. I didnʼt think
past the first step of
anything, that was the key.
I drank a Coke and didnʼt
worry about how to

recycle the can or about
the acid puddling in my
belly, acid so powerful it
could strip clean a penny.
We went to a dumb movie
and I didnʼt worry about
the offensive sexism or the
lack of minorities in
meaningful roles. I didnʼt
even worry whether the
movie made sense. I didnʼt
worry about anything that
came next. Nothing had

consequence, I was living
in the moment, and I could
feel
myself
getting
shallower and dumber. But
also happy.
Until Nick, Iʼd never
really felt like a person,
because I was always a
product. Amazing Amy has
to be brilliant, creative,
kind, thoughtful, witty,
and happy. We just want
you to be happy. Rand and

Marybeth said that all the
time, but they never
explained how. So many
lessons and opportunities
and advantages, and they
never taught me how to be
happy. I remember always
being baffled by other
children. I would be at a
birthday party and watch
the other kids giggling and
making faces, and I would
try to do that too, but I

wouldnʼt understand why.
I would sit there with the
tight elastic thread of the
birthday hat parting the
pudge of my underchin,
with the grainy frosting of
the cake bluing my teeth,
and I would try to figure
out why it was fun.
With
Nick,
I
understood
finally.
Because he was so much
fun. It was like dating a

sea otter. He was the first
naturally happy person I
met who was my equal. He
was brilliant and gorgeous
and funny and charming
and charmed. People liked
him. Women loved him. I
thought we would be the
most perfect union: the
happiest couple around.
Not that love is a
competition. But I donʼt
understand the point of

being together if youʼre
not the happiest.
I was probably happier
for those few years—
pretending to be someone
else—than I ever have
been before or after. I
canʼt decide what that
means.
But then it had to stop,
because it wasnʼt real, it
wasnʼt me. It wasnʼt me,
Nick! I thought you knew.

I thought it was a bit of a
game. I thought we had a
wink-wink, donʼt ask, donʼt
tell thing going. I tried so
hard to be easy. But it was
unsustainable. It turned
out he couldnʼt sustain his
side either: the witty
banter, the clever games,
the romance, and the
wooing. It all started
collapsing on itself. I hated
Nick for being surprised

when I became me. I hated
him for not knowing it had
to end, for truly believing
he had married this
creature, this figment of
the imagination of a
million masturbatory men,
semen-fingered and selfsatisfied. He truly seemed
astonished when I asked
him to listen to me. He
couldnʼt believe I didnʼt
love wax-stripping my

pussy raw and blowing
him on request. That I did
mind when he didnʼt show
up for drinks with my
friends. That ludicrous
diary entry? I donʼt need
pathetic
dancing-monkey
scenarios to repeat to my
friends, I am content with
letting him be himself.
That was pure, dumb
Cool Girl bullshit. What a
cunt. Again, I donʼt get it:

If you let a man cancel
plans or decline to do
things for you, you lose.
You donʼt get what you
want. Itʼs pretty clear.
Sure, he may be happy, he
may say youʼre the coolest
girl ever, but heʼs saying it
because he got his way.
Heʼs calling you a Cool
Girl to fool you! Thatʼs
what men do: They try to
make it sound like you are

the Cool Girl so you will
bow to their wishes. Like a
car salesman saying, How
much do you want to pay
for this beauty? when you
didnʼt agree to buy it yet.
That awful phrase men
use: “I mean, I know you
wouldnʼt mind if I …” Yes,
I do mind. Just say it. Donʼt
lose, you dumb little twat.
So it had to stop.
Committing
to
Nick,

feeling safe with Nick,
being happy with Nick,
made me realize that there
was a Real Amy in there,
and she was so much
better, more interesting
and
complicated
and
challenging, than Cool
Amy. Nick wanted Cool
Amy anyway. Can you
imagine, finally showing
your true self to your
spouse, your soul mate,

and having him not like
you? So thatʼs how the
hating first began. Iʼve
thought about this a lot,
and thatʼs where it started,
I think.

NICK DUNNE
SEVEN DAYS
GONE

I made it a few steps
into the woodshed before I
had to lean against the
wall and catch my breath.
I knew it was going to
be bad. I knew it once I

figured out the clue:
woodshed. Midday fun.
Cocktails. Because that
description was not me
and Amy. It was me and
Andie. The woodshed was
just one of many strange
places where Iʼd had sex
with Andie. We were
restricted in our meeting
spots. Her busy apartment
complex was mostly a no
go. Motels show up on

credit cards, and my wife
was neither trusting nor
stupid. (Andie had a
MasterCard,
but
the
statement went to her
mom. It hurts me to admit
that.) So the woodshed,
deep behind my sisterʼs
house, was very safe when
Go was at work. Likewise
my fatherʼs abandoned
home (Maybe you feel
guilty for bringing me here /

I must admit it felt a bit
queer / But itʼs not like we
had the choice of many a
place / We made the
decision: We made this our
space), and a few times,
my office at school (I
picture myself as your
student / With a teacher so
handsome and wise / My
mind opens up [not to
mention my thighs!]), and
once, Andieʼs car, pulled

down a dirt road in
Hannibal after Iʼd taken
her for a visit one day, a
much
more
satisfying
reenactment of my banal
field trip with Amy (You
took me here so I could hear
you chat / About your
boyhood
adventures:
crummy jeans and visor
hat).
Each clue was hidden
in a spot where Iʼd cheated

on Amy. Sheʼd used the
treasure hunt to take me
on a tour of all my
infidelities.
I
had
a
shimmer of nausea as I
pictured
Amy
trailing
oblivious me in her car—
to my dadʼs, to Goʼs, to
goddamn
Hannibal—
watching me fuck this
sweet young girl, my
wifeʼs lips twisting in
disgust and triumph.

Because she knew sheʼd
punish me good. Now at
our final stop, Amy was
ready for me to know how
clever she was. Because
the woodshed was packed
with about every gizmo
and gadget that I swore to
Boney and Gilpin I hadnʼt
bought with the credit
cards I swore I didnʼt
know anything about. The
insanely expensive golf

clubs were here, the
watches
and
game
consoles, the designer
clothes, they were all
sitting here, in wait, on my
sisterʼs property. Where it
looked like Iʼd stored them
until my wife was dead
and I could have a little
fun.
I knocked on Goʼs front
door, and when she
answered,
smoking
a

cigarette, I told her I had
to show her something,
and I turned around and
led her without a word to
the woodshed.
“Look,” I said, and
ushered her toward the
open door.
“Are those—Is that all
the stuff … from the credit
cards?” Goʼs voice went
high and wild. She put one
hand to her mouth and

took a step back from me,
and I realized that just for
a second, she thought I
was making a confession
to her.
Weʼd never be able to
undo it, that moment. For
that alone, I hated my
wife.
“Amyʼs framing me,
Go,” I said. “Go, Amy
bought this stuff. Sheʼs
framing me.”

She snapped to. Her
eyelids clicked once, twice,
and she gave a tiny shake
of her head, as if to rid
herself of the image: Nick
as wife killer.
“Amyʼs framing me for
her murder. Right? Her
last clue, it led me right
here, and no, I didnʼt
know about any of this
stuff. Itʼs her grand
statement. Presenting: Nick

Goes to Jail!” A huge,
burpy air bubble formed at
the back of my throat—I
was going to sob or laugh.
I laughed. “I mean, right?
Holy fuck, right?”
So hurry up, get going,
please do / And this time Iʼll
teach you a thing or two.
The final words of Amyʼs
first clue. How did I not
see it?
“If sheʼs framing you,

why let you know?” Go
was still staring, transfixed
by the contents of her
shed.
“Because sheʼs done it
so perfectly. She always
needed that validation, the
praise, all the time. She
wants me to know Iʼm
being fucked. She canʼt
resist. It wouldnʼt be fun
for her otherwise.”
“No,” Go said, chewing

on
a
nail.
“Thereʼs
something else. Something
more. Have you touched
anything in here?”
“No.”
“Good.
Then
the
question becomes …”
“What does she think
Iʼll do when I find this,
this
incriminating
evidence, on my sisterʼs
property,” I said. “Thatʼs
the
question,
because

whatever she assumes Iʼll
do, whatever she wants me
to do, I have to do the
opposite. If she thinks Iʼll
freak out and try to get rid
of all this stuff, I guarantee
you she has a way Iʼll get
busted with it.”
“Well, you canʼt leave
it here,” Go said. “Youʼll
definitely get busted that
way. Are you sure that was
the last clue? Whereʼs your

present?”
“Oh. Shit. No. It must
be inside somewhere.”
“Donʼt go in there,” Go
said.
“I have to. God knows
what else sheʼs got in
store.”
I stepped carefully into
the dank shed, keeping my
hands tight by my sides,
walking
delicately
on
tiptoes so as not to leave

tread marks. Just past a
flat-screen TV, Amyʼs blue
envelope sat on top of a
huge gift box, wrapped in
her beautiful silvery paper.
I took the envelope and
the box back outside into
the warm air. The object
inside the package was
heavy, a good thirty
pounds, and broken into
several pieces that slid
with a strange rattle as I

set the box on the ground
at our feet. Go took an
involuntary quick step
away from it. I slid open
the envelope.
Darling
Husband,
Now is when I
take the time to tell
you that I know you
better than you
could ever imagine.
I know sometimes

you think you are
moving through this
world
alone,
unseen, unnoticed.
But donʼt believe
that for a second. I
have made a study
of you. I know what
you are going to do
before you do it. I
know where youʼve
been, and I know
where youʼre going.

For
this
anniversary,
Iʼve
arranged a trip:
Follow your beloved
river, up up up! And
you donʼt even have
to
worry
about
trying to find your
anniversary present.
This
time
the
present will come to
you! So sit back and
relax, because you

are DONE.
“Whatʼs upriver?” Go
asked, and then I groaned.
“Sheʼs sending me up
the river.”
“Fuck her. Open the
box.”
I knelt down and
nudged off the lid with my
fingertips, as if expecting
an explosion. Silence. I
peered inside. At the
bottom of the box lay two

wooden puppets, side by
side. They seemed to be
husband and wife. The
male was dressed in
motley
and
grinning
rabidly, holding a cane or
a stick. I pulled the
husband figure out, his
limbs bouncing around
excitedly,
a
dancer
limbering up. The wife
was
prettier,
more
delicate, and stiffer. Her

face looked shocked, as if
sheʼd
seen
something
alarming. Beneath her was
a tiny baby that could be
attached to her by a
ribbon. The puppets were
ancient, heavy, and large,
almost
as
big
as
ventriloquist dummies. I
picked up the male,
gripped the thick, clublike
handle used to move him,
and his arms and legs

twitched manically.
“Creepy,”
Go
said.
“Stop.”
Beneath them lay a
piece of buttery blue paper
folded over once. Amyʼs
broken-kite handwriting,
all triangles and points. It
read:
The beginning of
a wonderful new
story, Nick! “Thatʼs
the way to do it!”

Enjoy.
On our momʼs kitchen
table, we spread all of
Amyʼs treasure-hunt clues
and the box containing the
puppets. We stared at the
objects as if we were
assembling
a
jigsaw
puzzle.
“Why bother with a
treasure hunt if she was
planning … her plan,” Go
said.

Her plan had become
immediate shorthand for
faking her disappearance
and framing you for murder.
It sounded less insane.
“Keep me distracted,
for one thing. Make me
believe she still loved me.
Iʼm chasing her little clues
all
over
Christendom,
believing my wife was
wanting to make amends,
wanting to jump-start our

marriage …”
The moony, girlish
state her notes had left me
in, it sickened me. It
embarrassed me. Marrowdeep embarrassment, the
kind that becomes part of
your DNA, that changes
you. After all these years,
Amy could still play me.
She could write a few
notes and get me back
completely. I was her little

puppet on a string.
I will find you, Amy.
Lovesick words, hateful
intentions.
“So I donʼt stop to
think: Hey, it sure looks like
I murdered my wife, I
wonder why?”
“And the police would
have found it strange—you
would have found it
strange—if she didnʼt do
the treasure hunt, this

tradition,” Go reasoned. “It
would look as if she knew
she
was
going
to
disappear.”
“This
worries
me
though,” I said, pointing at
the
puppets.
“Theyʼre
unusual enough that they
have to mean something. I
mean, if she just wanted to
keep me distracted for a
while, the final gift could
have
been
anything

wooden.”
Go ran a finger across
the maleʼs motley uniform.
“Theyʼre clearly very old.
Vintage.” She flipped their
clothing upside down to
reveal the club handle of
the male. The female had
only a square-shaped gap
at her head. “Is this
supposed to be sexual? The
male
has
this
giant
wooden handle, like a

dick. And the female is
missing hers. She just has
the hole.”
“Itʼs a fairly obvious
statement:
Men
have
penises and women have
vaginas?”
Go put a finger inside
the female puppetʼs gap,
swept around to make sure
there was nothing hidden.
“So what is Amy saying?”
“When I first saw them,

I thought: She bought
childrenʼs toys. Mom, dad,
baby. Because she was
pregnant.”
“Is she even pregnant?”
A sense of despair
washed over me. Or
rather, the opposite. Not a
wave coming in, rolling
over me, but the ebb of the
sea returning: a sense of
something pulling away,
and me with it. I could no

longer hope my wife was
pregnant, but I couldnʼt
bring myself to hope she
wasnʼt either.
Go pulled out the male
doll, scrunched her nose,
then
lightbulb-popped.
“Youʼre a puppet on a
string.”
I laughed. “I literally
thought those exact words
too. But why a male and
female? Amy clearly isnʼt a

puppet on a string, sheʼs
the puppetmaster.”
“And whatʼs: Thatʼs the
way to do it? To do what?”
“Fuck me for life?”
“Itʼs not a phrase Amy
used to say? Or some
quote from the Amy books,
or …” She hurried over to
her computer and searched
for Thatʼs the way to do it.
Up came lyrics for “Thatʼs
the Way to Do It” by

Madness. “Oh, I remember
them,” Go said. “Awesome
ska band.”
“Ska,” I said, swerving
toward delirious laughter.
“Great.”
The lyrics were about a
handyman who could do
many types of homeimprovement
jobs—
including electrical and
plumbing—and
who
preferred to be paid in

cash.
“God, I fucking hate the
eighties,” I said. “No lyrics
ever made sense.”
“ ʻThe reflex is an only
child,ʼ ” Go said, nodding.
“ ʻHeʼs waiting by the
park,ʼ ” I muttered back
automatically.
“So if this is it, what
does it mean?” Go said,
turning to me, studying
my eyes. “Itʼs a song about

a handyman. Someone
who might have access to
your house, to fix things.
Or rig things. Who would
be paid in cash so thereʼs
no record.”
“Someone
who
installed video cameras?” I
asked. “Amy went out of
town a few times during
the—the affair. Maybe she
thought sheʼd catch us on
tape.”

Go shot a question at
me.
“No, never, never at
our house.”
“Could it be some
secret
door?”
Go
suggested. “Some secret
false panel Amy put in
where
sheʼs
hidden
something that will … I
donʼt know, exonerate
you?”
“I think thatʼs it. Yes,

Amy is using a Madness
song to give me a clue to
my own freedom, if only I
can decipher their wily,
ska-infused codes.”
Go laughed then too.
“Jesus, maybe weʼre the
ones who are bat-shit
crazy. I mean, are we? Is
this totally insane?”
“Itʼs not insane. She set
me up. There is no other
way
to
explain
the

warehouse of stuff in your
backyard. And itʼs very
Amy to drag you into it,
smudge you a little bit
with my filth. No, this is
Amy. The gift, the fucking
giddy,
sly
note
Iʼm
supposed to understand.
No, and it has to come
back to the puppets. Try
the quote with the word
marionettes.”
I collapsed on the

couch, my body a dull
throb. Go played secretary.
“Oh my God. Duh! Theyʼre
Punch and Judy dolls.
Nick! Weʼre idiots. That
line,
thatʼs
Punchʼs
trademark. Thatʼs the way
to do it!”
“Okay. The old puppet
show—itʼs really violent,
right?” I asked.
“This is so fucked up.”
“Go, itʼs violent, right?”

“Yeah. Violent. God,
sheʼs fucking crazy.”
“He beats her, right?”
“Iʼm reading … okay.
Punch kills their baby.”
She looked up at me. “And
then when Judy confronts
him, he beats her. To
death.”
My throat got wet with
saliva.
“And each time he does
something awful and gets

away with it, he says,
ʻThatʼs the way to do it!ʼ ”
She grabbed Punch and
placed him in her lap, her
fingers
grasping
the
wooden hands as if she
were holding an infant.
“Heʼs glib, even as he
murders his wife and
child.”
I looked at the puppets.
“So sheʼs giving me the
narrative of my frame-up.”

“I canʼt even wrap my
brain around this. Fucking
psycho.”
“Go?”
“Yeah, right: You didnʼt
want her to be pregnant,
you got angry and killed
her and the unborn baby.”
“Feels
anticlimactic
somehow,” I said.
“The climax is when
you are taught the lesson
that Punch never learns,

and you are caught and
charged with murder.”
“And Missouri has the
death penalty,” I said. “Fun
game.”

AMY
ELLIOTT
DUNNE
THE DAY OF

You know how I found
out? I saw them. Thatʼs
how stupid my husband is.
One snowy April night, I

felt so lonely. I was
drinking warm amaretto
with Bleecker and reading,
lying on the floor as the
snow came down, listening
to old scratchy albums,
like Nick and I used to
(that entry was true). I had
a burst of romantic cheer:
Iʼd surprise him at The
Bar, and weʼd have a few
drinks and wander through
the empty streets together,

hand in mitten. We would
walk around the hushed
downtown and he would
press me against a wall
and kiss me in the snow
that looked like sugar
clouds. Thatʼs right, I
wanted him back so badly
that I was willing to recreate that moment. I was
willing to pretend to be
someone else again. I
remember thinking: We

can still find a way to make
this work. Faith! I followed
him all the way to
Missouri, because I still
believed heʼd love me
again somehow, love me
that intense, thick way he
did, the way that made
everything good. Faith!
I got there just in time
to see him leaving with
her. I was in the goddamn
parking lot, twenty feet

behind him, and he didnʼt
even register me, I was a
ghost. He didnʼt have his
hands on her, not yet, but I
knew. I could tell because
he was so aware of her. I
followed
them,
and
suddenly, he pressed her
up against a tree—in the
middle of town—and kissed
her. Nick is cheating, I
thought
dumbly,
and
before I could make myself

say anything, they were
going up to her apartment.
I waited for an hour,
sitting on the doorstep,
then got too cold—blue
fingernails,
chattering
teeth—and went home. He
never even knew I knew.
I had a new persona,
not of my choosing. I was
Average Dumb Woman
Married to Average Shitty
Man. He had single-

handedly
de-amazed
Amazing Amy.
I know women whose
entire personas are woven
from a benign mediocrity.
Their lives are a list of
shortcomings:
the
unappreciative boyfriend,
the extra ten pounds, the
dismissive
boss,
the
conniving
sister,
the
straying husband. Iʼve
always hovered above

their stories, nodding in
sympathy and thinking
how foolish they are, these
women, to let these things
happen,
how
undisciplined. And now to
be one of them! One of the
women with the endless
stories that make people
nod sympathetically and
think: Poor dumb bitch.
I could hear the tale,
how everyone would love

telling it: how Amazing
Amy, the girl who never
did wrong, let herself be
dragged, penniless, to the
middle of the country,
where her husband threw
her over for a younger
woman. How predictable,
how perfectly average,
how amusing. And her
husband? He ended up
happier than ever. No. I
couldnʼt allow that. No.

Never. Never. He doesnʼt
get to do this to me and
still fucking win. No.
I changed my name for
that
piece
of
shit.
Historical records have
been altered—Amy Elliott
to Amy Dunne—like itʼs
nothing. No, he does not
get to win.
So I began to think of a
different story, a better
story, that would destroy

Nick for doing this to me.
A story that would restore
my perfection. It would
make me the hero, flawless
and adored.
Because everyone loves
the Dead Girl.
Itʼs rather extreme,
framing your husband for
your murder. I want you to
know I know that. All the
tut-tutters out there will
say: She should have just

left, bundled up what
remained of her dignity.
Take the high road! Two
wrongs donʼt make a right!
All those things that
spineless
women
say,
confusing their weakness
with morality.
I wonʼt divorce him
because thatʼs exactly
what heʼd like. And I
wonʼt forgive him because
I donʼt feel like turning the

other cheek. Can I make it
any more clear? I wonʼt
find that a satisfactory
ending. The bad guy wins?
Fuck him.
For over a year now,
Iʼve smelled her twat on
his fingertips as he slipped
into bed next to me. Iʼve
watched him ogle himself
in the mirror, grooming
himself like a horny
baboon for their dates. Iʼve

listened to his lies, lies, lies
—from simplistic childʼs
fibs to elaborate Rube
Goldbergian contraptions.
Iʼve tasted butterscotch on
his dry-kiss lips, a cloying
flavor that was never there
before. Iʼve felt the stubble
on his cheeks that he
knows I donʼt like but
apparently she does. Iʼve
suffered betrayal with all
five senses. For over a

year.
So I may have gone a
bit mad. I do know that
framing your husband for
your murder is beyond the
pale of what an average
woman might do.
But
itʼs
so
very
necessary. Nick must be
taught a lesson. Heʼs never
been taught a lesson! He
glides through life with
that charming-Nicky grin,

his
beloved-child
entitlement, his fibs and
shirkings, his shortcomings
and selfishness, and no one
calls him on anything. I
think this experience will
make him a better person.
Or at least a sorrier one.
Fucker.
Iʼve always thought I
could commit the perfect
murder. People who get
caught get caught because

they donʼt have patience;
they refuse to plan. I smile
again as I shift my crappy
getaway car into fifth gear
(Carthage now seventyeight miles in the dust)
and brace myself for a
speeding truck—the car
seems ready to take flight
every time a semi passes.
But I do smile, because
this car shows just how
smart I am: purchased for

twelve hundred dollars
cash from a Craigslist
posting. Five months ago,
so the memory wouldnʼt
be fresh in anyoneʼs mind.
A 1992 Ford Festiva, the
tiniest, most forgettable
car in the world. I met the
sellers at night, in the
parking lot of a Walmart
in Jonesboro, Arkansas. I
took the train down with a
bundle of cash in my purse

—eight hours each way,
while Nick was on a boysʼ
trip. (And by boysʼ trip, I
mean fucking the slut.) I ate
in the trainʼs dining car, a
clump of lettuce with two
cherry tomatoes that the
menu described as a salad.
I was seated with a
melancholy
farmer
returning
home
after
visiting
his
baby
granddaughter for the first

time.
The couple selling the
Ford seemed as interested
in discretion as I. The
woman remained in the
car the whole time, a
pacifiered toddler in her
arms,
watching
her
husband and me trade
cash for keys. (That is the
correct
grammar,
you
know: her husband and
me.) Then she got out and

I got in. That quick. In the
rearview mirror, I saw the
couple
strolling
into
Walmart with their money.
Iʼve been parking it in
long-term lots in St. Louis.
I go down twice a month
and park it somewhere
new. Pay cash. Wear a
baseball cap. Easy enough.
So thatʼs just an
example.
Of
patience,
planning, and ingenuity. I

am pleased with myself; I
have three hours more
until I reach the thick of
the Missouri Ozarks and
my destination, a small
archipelago of cabins in
the woods that accepts
cash for weekly rentals
and has cable TV, a must. I
plan to hole up there the
first week or two; I donʼt
want to be on the road
when the news hits, and

itʼs the last place Nick
would think Iʼd hide once
he realizes Iʼm hiding.
This stretch of highway
is
particularly
ugly.
Middle-America
blight.
After
another
twenty
miles, I see, up on the offramp, the remains of a
lonesome
family
gas
station, vacant but not
boarded up, and when I
pull to the side, I see the

womenʼs restroom door
swung wide. I enter—no
electricity, but thereʼs a
warped metal mirror and
the water is still on. In the
afternoon sunlight and the
sauna heat, I remove from
my purse a pair of metal
scissors and bunny-brown
hair dye. I shear off large
chunks of my hair. All the
blond goes into a plastic
bag. Air hits the back of

my neck, and my head
feels light, like a balloon—
I roll it around a few times
to enjoy. I apply the color,
check my watch, and
linger in the doorway,
looking out over miles of
flatland pocked with fastfood restaurants and motel
chains. I can feel an Indian
crying. (Nick would hate
that joke. Derivative! And
then heʼd add, “although

the word derivative as a
criticism
is
itself
derivative.” Iʼve got to get
him out of my head—he
still steps on my lines from
a hundred miles away.) I
wash my hair in the sink,
the warm water making
me sweat, and then back
in the car with my bag of
hair and trash. I put on a
pair of outdated wire-rim
glasses and look in the

rearview mirror and smile
again. Nick and I would
never have married if I
had looked like this when
we met. All this could
have been avoided if I
were less pretty.
Item 34: Change look.
Check.
Iʼm not sure, exactly,
how to be Dead Amy. Iʼm
trying to figure out what
that means for me, what I

become for the next few
months.
Anyone,
I
suppose, except people
Iʼve already been: Amazing
Amy. Preppy ʼ80s Girl.
Ultimate-Frisbee Granola
and Blushing Ingenue and
Witty
Hepburnian
Sophisticate. Brainy Ironic
Girl and Boho Babe (the
latest version of Frisbee
Granola). Cool Girl and
Loved Wife and Unloved

Wife and Vengeful Scorned
Wife. Diary Amy.
I hope you liked Diary
Amy. She was meant to be
likable. Meant for someone
like you to like her. Sheʼs
easy to like. Iʼve never
understood why thatʼs
considered a compliment
—that just anyone could
like you. No matter. I
thought the entries turned
out nicely, and it wasnʼt

simple. I had to maintain
an affable if somewhat
naive persona, a woman
who loved her husband
and could see some of his
flaws (otherwise sheʼd be
too much of a sap) but was
sincerely devoted to him—
all the while leading the
reader (in this case, the
cops, I am so eager for
them to find it) toward the
conclusion that Nick was

indeed planning to kill me.
So many clues to unpack,
so many surprises ahead!
Nick always mocked
my endless lists. (“Itʼs like
you make sure youʼre
never satisfied, that thereʼs
always something else to
be perfected, instead of
just
enjoying
the
moment.”) But who wins
here? I win, because my
list, the master list entitled

Fuck Nick Dunne, was
exacting—it was the most
complete, fastidious list
that has ever been created.
On my list was Write Diary
Entries for 2005 to 2012.
Seven years of diary
entries, not every day, but
twice monthly, at least. Do
you know how much
discipline
that
takes?
Would Cool Girl Amy be
able to do that? To

research
each
weekʼs
current events, to crossconsult with my old daily
planners to make sure I
forgot nothing important,
then to reconstruct how
Diary Amy would react to
each event? It was fun,
mostly. Iʼd wait for Nick to
leave for The Bar, or to go
meet his mistress, the evertexting,
gum-chewing,
vapid mistress with her

acrylic nails and the
sweatpants with logos
across the butt (she isnʼt
like this, exactly, but she
might as well be), and Iʼd
pour some coffee or open a
bottle of wine, pick one of
my thirty-two different
pens, and rewrite my life a
little.
It is true that I
sometimes hated Nick less
while I was doing this. A

giddy Cool Girl perspective
will do that. Sometimes
Nick would come home,
stinking of beer or of the
hand sanitizer he wiped on
his body post-mistresscoitus
(never
entirely
erased the stink, though—
she must have one rank
pussy), and smile guiltily
at me, be all sweet and
hangdog with me, and Iʼd
almost think: I wonʼt go

through with this. And then
Iʼd picture him with her,
in her stripper thong,
letting him degrade her
because
she
was
pretending to be Cool Girl,
she was pretending to love
blow jobs and football and
getting wasted. And Iʼd
think, I am married to an
imbecile. Iʼm married to a
man who will always choose
that, and when he gets bored

with this dumb twat, heʼll
just find another girl who is
pretending to be that girl,
and heʼll never have to do
anything hard in his life.
Resolve stiffened.
One hundred and fiftytwo entries total, and I
donʼt think I ever lose her
voice. I wrote her very
carefully, Diary Amy. She
is designed to appeal to
the cops, to appeal to the

public should portions be
released. They have to
read this diary like itʼs
some sort of Gothic
tragedy. A wonderful,
good-hearted
woman—
whole life ahead of her,
everything going for her,
whatever else they say
about women who die—
chooses the wrong mate
and pays the ultimate price.
They have to like me. Her.

My
parents
are
worried, of course, but
how can I feel sorry for
them, since they made me
this way and then deserted
me? They never, ever fully
appreciated the fact that
they were earning money
from my existence, that I
should have been getting
royalties. Then, after they
siphoned off my money,
my “feminist” parents let

Nick bundle me off to
Missouri like I was some
piece of chattel, some
mail-order bride, some
property exchange. Gave
me a fucking cuckoo clock
to remember them by.
Thanks for thirty-six years
of service! They deserve to
think Iʼm dead, because
thatʼs practically the state
they consigned me to: no
money, no home, no

friends. They deserve to
suffer too. If you canʼt take
care of me while Iʼm alive,
you have made me dead
anyway. Just like Nick,
who
destroyed
and
rejected the real me a
piece at a time—youʼre too
serious, Amy, youʼre too
uptight, Amy, you overthink
things, you analyze too
much, youʼre no fun
anymore, you make me feel

useless, Amy, you make me
feel bad, Amy. He took
away chunks of me with
blasé
swipes:
my
independence, my pride,
my esteem. I gave, and he
took and took. He Giving
Treed me out of existence.
That whore, he picked
that little whore over me.
He killed my soul, which
should
be
a
crime.
Actually, it is a crime.

According to me, at least.

NICK DUNNE
SEVEN
DAYS
GONE

I had to phone Tanner,
my brand-new lawyer,
mere hours after Iʼd hired
him, and say the words

that would make him
regret taking my money: I
think my wife is framing me.
I couldnʼt see his face, but
I could imagine it—the eye
roll, the grimace, the
weariness of a man who
hears nothing but lies for a
living.
“Well,” he finally said
after a gaping pause, “Iʼll
be
there
first
thing
tomorrow morning, and

we will sort this out—
everything on the table—
and in the meantime, sit
tight, okay? Go to sleep
and sit tight.”
Go took his advice; she
popped two sleeping pills
and left me just before
eleven, while I literally sat
tight, in an angry ball on
her couch. Every so often
Iʼd go outside and glare at
the woodshed, my hands

on my hips, as if it were a
predator I could scare off.
Iʼm not sure what I
thought
I
was
accomplishing,
but
I
couldnʼt stop myself. I
could stay seated for five
minutes, tops, before Iʼd
have to go back outside
and stare.
I had just come back
inside when a knock
rattled the back door.

Fucking Christ. Not quite
midnight. Cops would
come to the front—right?
—and reporters had yet to
stake out Goʼs (this would
change, in a matter of
days,
hours).
I
was
standing,
unnerved,
undecided, in the living
room when the banging
came again, louder, and I
cursed under my breath,
tried to get myself angry

instead of scared. Deal with
it, Dunne.
I flung open the door.
It was Andie. It was
goddamn Andie, pretty as
a picture, dressed up for
the occasion, still not
getting it—that she was
going to put my neck right
in the noose.
“Right in the noose,
Andie.” I yanked her
inside, and she stared at

my hand on her arm. “You
are going to put my neck
right in the fucking noose.”
“I came to the back
door,” she said. When I
stared her down, she
didnʼt
apologize,
she
steeled herself. I could
literally see her features
harden. “I needed to see
you, Nick. I told you. I told
you I had to see you or
talk to you every day, and

today you disappeared.
Straight to voice mail,
straight to voice mail,
straight to voice mail.”
“If you donʼt hear from
me, itʼs because I canʼt
talk, Andie. Jesus, I was in
New York, getting a
lawyer. Heʼll be here first
thing tomorrow.”
“You got a lawyer. That
was what kept you so busy
that you couldnʼt call me

for ten seconds?”
I wanted to smack her.
I took a breath. I had to
cut things off with Andie.
It wasnʼt just Tannerʼs
warning I had in mind. My
wife knew me: She knew
Iʼd do almost anything to
avoid
dealing
with
confrontation. Amy was
depending on me to be
stupid,
to
let
the
relationship linger—and to

ultimately be caught. I had
to end it. But I had to do it
perfectly. Make her believe
that this was the decent
thing.
“Heʼs actually given me
some important advice,” I
began. “Advice I canʼt
ignore.”
Iʼd been so sweet and
doting just last night, at
my mandatory meeting in
our pretend fort. Iʼd made

so many promises, trying
to calm her down. She
wouldnʼt see this coming.
She wouldnʼt take this
well.
“Advice? Good. Is it to
stop being such an asshole
to me?”
I felt the rage rise up;
that this was already
turning into a high school
fight. A thirty-four-yearold man in the middle of

the worst night of my life,
and I was having a meet me
by the lockers! squabble
with a pissed-off girl. I
shook her once, hard, a
tiny droplet of spit landing
on her lower lip.
“I— You donʼt get it,
Andie. This isnʼt some
joke, this is my life.”
“I just … I need you,”
she said, looking down at
her hands. “I know I keep

saying that, but I do. I
canʼt do it, Nick. I canʼt go
on like this. Iʼm falling
apart. Iʼm so scared all the
time.”
She was scared. I
pictured
the
police
knocking, and here I was
with a girl Iʼd been fucking
the morning my wife went
missing. Iʼd sought her out
that day—I had never
gone to her apartment

since that first night, but I
went right there that
morning, because Iʼd spent
hours with my heart
pounding behind my ears,
trying to get myself to say
the words to Amy: I want a
divorce. I am in love with
someone else. We have to
end. I canʼt pretend to love
you, I canʼt do the
anniversary thing—it would
actually be more wrong than

cheating on you in the first
place. (I know: debatable.)
But while I was gathering
the
guts,
Amy
had
preempted me with her
speech about still loving
me (lying bitch!), and I
lost my nerve. I felt like
the ultimate cheat and
coward, and—the catch-22
—I craved Andie to make
me feel better.
But Andie was no

longer the antidote to my
nerves. Quite the opposite.
The girl was wrapping
herself around me even
now, oblivious as a weed.
“Look, Andie,” I said, a
big exhale, not letting her
sit down, keeping her near
the door. “You are such a
special person to me.
Youʼve handled all this so
amazingly well—” Make
her want to keep you safe.

“I mean …” Her voice
wavered. “I feel so sorry,
for Amy. Which is insane. I
know I donʼt even have a
right to feel sad for her, or
worried. And on top of
feeling sad, I feel so
guilty.” She leaned her
head against my chest. I
retreated, held her at
armʼs length so she had to
look at me.
“Well, thatʼs one thing I

think we can fix. I think
we need to fix,” I said,
pulling up Tannerʼs exact
words.
“We should go to the
police,” she said. “Iʼm your
alibi for that morning,
weʼll just tell them.”
“Youʼre my alibi for
about
an
hour
that
morning,” I said. “No one
saw or heard Amy after
eleven P.M. the night

before. The police can say
I killed her before I saw
you.”
“Thatʼs disgusting.”
I shrugged. I thought,
for a second, about telling
her about Amy—my wife is
framing me—and quickly
dismissed
it.
Andie
couldnʼt play the game on
Amyʼs level. Sheʼd want to
be my teammate, and
sheʼd drag me down.

Andie would be a liability
going forward. I put my
hands on her arms again,
relaunched my speech.
“Look, Andie, we are
both under an amazing
amount of stress and
pressure, and a lot of it is
brought on by our feelings
of guilt. Andie, the thing
is, we are good people. We
were attracted to each
other, I think, because we

both have similar values.
Of treating people right, of
doing the right thing. And
right now we know what
we are doing is wrong.”
Her broken, hopeful
expression changed—the
wet eyes, the gentle touch,
they disappeared: a weird
flicker, a window shade
pulled down, something
darker in her face.
“We need to end this,

Andie. I think we both
know that. Itʼs so hard, but
itʼs the decent thing to do.
I think itʼs the advice weʼd
give ourselves if we could
think straight. As much as
I love you, I am still
married to Amy. I have to
do the right thing.”
“And if sheʼs found?”
She didnʼt say dead or
alive.
“Thatʼs something we

can discuss then.”
“Then! And until then,
what?”
I shrugged helplessly:
Until then, nothing.
“What, Nick? I fuck off
until then?”
“Thatʼs an ugly choice
of words.”
“But thatʼs what you
mean.” She smirked.
“Iʼm sorry, Andie. I
donʼt think itʼs right for

me to be with you right
now. Itʼs dangerous for
you, itʼs dangerous for me.
It doesnʼt sit well with my
conscience. Itʼs just how I
feel.”
“Yeah? You know how
I feel?” Her eyes burst
over, tears streaming down
her cheeks. “I feel like a
dumb college girl that you
started fucking because
you were bored with your

wife and I made it
extremely convenient for
you. You could go home to
Amy and eat dinner with
her and play around in
your little bar that you
bought with her money,
and then you could meet
me at your dying dadʼs
house and jack off on my
tits because, poor you,
your mean wife would
never let you do that.”

“Andie,
you
know
thatʼs not—”
“What a shit you are.
What kind of man are
you?”
“Andie, please.” Contain
this, Nick. “I think because
you havenʼt been able to
talk about this stuff,
everything has gotten a
little bigger in your mind,
a little—”
“Fuck you. You think

Iʼm some dumb kid, some
pathetic student you can
manage? I stick by you
through all this—this talk
about how you might be a
murderer—and as soon as
itʼs a little tough for you?
No, no. You donʼt get to
talk about conscience and
decency and guilt and feel
like you are doing the
right thing. Do you
understand me? Because

you are a cheating,
cowardly, selfish shit.”
She turned away from
me, sobbing, sucking in
loud gulps of moist air,
and breathing out mewls,
and I tried to stop her, I
grabbed her by the arm.
“Andie, this isnʼt how I
want to—”
“Hands off me! Hands
off me!”
She moved toward the

back door, and I could see
what would happen, the
hatred and embarrassment
coming off her like heat, I
knew sheʼd open a bottle
of wine, or two, and then
sheʼd tell a friend, or her
mother, and it would
spread like an infection.
I moved in front of her,
barring her way to the
door—Andie, please—and
she reached up to slap me,

and I grabbed her arm, just
for defense. Our joined
arms moved up and down
and up and down like
crazed dance partners.
“Let me go, Nick, or I
swear …”
“Just stay for a minute.
Just listen to me.”
“You, let me go!”
She moved her face
toward mine like she was
going to kiss me. She bit

me. I jerked back and she
shot out the door.

AMY ELLIOTT
DUNNE
FIVE DAYS GONE

You may call me Ozark
Amy. I am ensconced in
the Hide-A-Way Cabins
(has ever there been a
more apt name?), and I sit
quietly, watching all the

levers and latches I put in
place do their work.
I have shed myself of
Nick, and yet I think about
him more than ever. Last
night at 10:04 P.M. my
disposable cell phone rang.
(Thatʼs right, Nick, youʼre
not the only one who
knows the old “secret cell
phone” trick.) It was the
alarm company. I didnʼt
answer, of course, but now

I know Nick has made it as
far as his dadʼs house. Clue
3. I changed the code two
weeks before I disappeared
and listed my secret cell as
the first number to call. I
can picture Nick, my clue
in hand, entering his dadʼs
dusty,
stale
house,
fumbling with the alarm
code … then the time runs
out. Beep beep beeeep! His
cell is listed as the backup

if I canʼt be reached (and I
obviously canʼt).
So he tripped the
alarm, and he talked to
someone at the alarm
company, and so heʼs on
record as being in his
dadʼs house after my
disappearance. Which is
good for the plan. Itʼs not
foolproof, but it doesnʼt
have to be foolproof. Iʼve
already left enough for the

police to make a case
against Nick: the staged
scene, the mopped-up
blood, the credit-card bills.
All these will be found by
even the most incompetent
police departments. Noelle
will spill my pregnancy
news very soon (if she
hasnʼt already). It is
enough, especially once
the police discover Able
Andie (able to suck cock

on command). So all these
extras, theyʼre just bonus
fuck-yous. Amusing booby
traps. I love that I am a
woman with booby traps.
Ellen Abbott is part of
my plan too. The biggest
cable crime-news show in
the country. I adore Ellen
Abbott,
I
love
how
protective and maternal
she gets about all the
missing women on her

show, and how rabid-dog
vicious she is once she
seizes on a suspect, usually
the husband. She is
Americaʼs voice of female
righteousness. Which is
why Iʼd really like her to
take on my story. The
Public must turn against
Nick. Itʼs as much a part of
his punishment as prison,
for darling Nicky—who
spends so much time

worrying about people
liking him—to know he is
universally hated. And I
need Ellen to keep me
apprised
of
the
investigation. Have the
police found my diary yet?
Do they know about
Andie?
Have
they
discovered the bumped-up
life insurance? This is the
hardest part: waiting for
stupid people to figure

things out.
I flip on the TV in my
little room once an hour,
eager to see if Ellen has
picked up my story. She
has to, I canʼt see how she
could resist. I am pretty,
Nick is pretty, and I have
the Amazing Amy hook.
Just before noon, she
flares up, promising a
special report. I stay tuned,
glaring at the TV: Hurry

up, Ellen. Or: Hurry up,
Ellen. We have that in
common: We are both
people and entities. Amy
and Amy, Ellen and Ellen.
Tampon commercial,
detergent
commercial,
maxipad
commercial,
Windex commercial. Youʼd
think all women do is
clean and bleed.
And finally! There I
am! My debut!

I know from the second
Ellen shows up, glowering
like Elvis, that this is going
to be good. A few
gorgeous photos of me, a
still shot of Nick with his
insane love me! grin from
the first press conference.
News: There has been a
fruitless multi-site search
for “the beautiful young
woman with everything
going for her.” News: Nick

fucked himself already.
Taking candid photos with
a townie during a search
for me. This is clearly
what
hooked
Ellen,
because she is pissed. There
he is, Nick in his sweetiepie mode, the I am the
beloved of all women mode,
his face pressed against the
strange womanʼs, as if
theyʼre
happy-hour
buddies.

What an idiot. I love it.
Ellen Abbott is making
much of the fact that our
backyard leads right to the
Mississippi River. I wonder
then if it has been leaked
—the search history on
Nickʼs computer, which I
made sure includes a study
on the locks and dams of
the Mississippi, as well as
a Google search of the
words body float Mississippi

River. Not to put too fine a
point on it. It could
happen—possibly,
unlikely, but there is
precedent—that the river
might sweep my body all
the way to the ocean. Iʼve
actually felt sad for myself,
picturing my slim, naked,
pale body, floating just
beneath the current, a
colony of snails attached
to one bare leg, my hair

trailing like seaweed until
I reach the ocean and drift
down down down to the
bottom, my waterlogged
flesh peeling off in soft
streaks,
me
slowly
disappearing
into
the
current like a watercolor
until just the bones are
left.
But Iʼm a romantic. In
real life, if Nick had killed
me, I think he would have

just rolled my body into a
trash bag and driven me to
one of the landfills in the
sixty-mile radius. Just
dispose of me. Heʼd have
even taken a few items
with him—the broken
toaster thatʼs not worth
fixing, a pile of old VHS
tapes heʼs been meaning to
toss—to make the trip
efficient.
Iʼm learning to live

fairly efficiently myself. A
girl has to budget when
sheʼs dead. I had time to
plan, to stockpile some
cash: I gave myself a good
twelve months between
deciding to disappear and
disappearing. Thatʼs why
most people get caught in
murders: They donʼt have
the discipline to wait. I
have $10,200 in cash. If
Iʼd cleared out $10,200 in

a month, that would have
been
noticed.
But
I
collected cash forwards
from credit cards I took
out in Nickʼs name—the
cards that would make
him look like a greedy
little
cheat—and
I
siphoned
off
another
$4,400 from our bank
accounts over the months:
withdrawals of $200 or
$300, nothing to attract

attention. I stole from
Nick, from his pockets,
$20 here, $10 there, a
slow deliberate stockpile—
itʼs like that budgeting
plan where you put the
money youʼd spend on
your morning Starbucks
into a jar, and at the end
of the year you have
$1,500. And Iʼd always
steal from the tip jar when
I went to The Bar. Iʼm sure

Nick blamed Go, and Go
blamed Nick, and neither
of them said anything
because they felt too sorry
for the other.
But I am careful with
money, my point. I have
enough to live on until I
kill myself. Iʼm going to
hide out long enough to
watch
Lance
Nicholas
Dunne
become
a
worldwide
pariah,
to

watch Nick be arrested,
tried, marched off to
prison, bewildered in an
orange
jumpsuit
and
handcuffs. To watch Nick
squirm and sweat and
swear he is innocent and
still be stuck. Then I will
travel south along the
river, where I will meet up
with my body, my pretend
floating Other Amy body
in the Gulf of Mexico. I

will sign up for a booze
cruise—something to get
me out into the deep end
but
nothing
requiring
identification. I will drink
a giant ice-wet shaker of
gin, and I will swallow
sleeping pills, and when no
one is looking, Iʼll drop
silently over the side, my
pockets full of Virginia
Woolf rocks. It requires
discipline,
to
drown

oneself,
but
I
have
discipline in spades. My
body may never be
discovered, or it may
resurface weeks, months,
later—eroded to the point
that my death canʼt be
time-stamped—and I will
provide a last bit of
evidence to make sure
Nick is marched to the
padded cross, the prison
table where heʼll be

pumped with poison and
die.
Iʼd like to wait around
and see him dead, but
given the state of our
justice system, that may
take years, and I have
neither the money nor the
stamina. Iʼm ready to join
the Hopes.
I did veer from my
budget a bit already. I
spent about $500 on items

to nice-up my cabin—good
sheets, a decent lamp,
towels that donʼt stand up
by themselves from years
of bleaching. But I try to
accept what Iʼm offered.
Thereʼs a man a few cabins
away, a taciturn fellow, a
hippie dropout of the
Grizzly
Adams,
homemade-granola variety
—full beard and turquoise
rings and a guitar he plays

on his back deck some
nights. His name, he says,
is Jeff, just like my name, I
say, is Lydia. We smile
only in passing, but he
brings me fish. A couple of
times now, he brings a fish
by, freshly stinking but
scaled and headless, and
presents it to me in a giant
icy freezer bag. “Fresh
fish!” he says, knocking,
and if I donʼt open the

door
immediately,
he
disappears, leaving the bag
on my front doorstep. I
cook the fish in a decent
skillet I bought at yet
another Walmart, and itʼs
not bad, and itʼs free.
“Where do you get all
the fish?” I ask him.
“At the getting place,”
he says.
Dorothy, who works
the front desk and has

already taken a liking to
me, brings tomatoes from
her garden. I eat the
tomatoes that smell like
the earth and the fish that
smells like the lake. I think
that by next year, Nick
will be locked away in a
place that smells only of
the
inside.
Fabricated
odors: deodorant and old
shoes and starchy foods,
stale mattresses. His worst

fear, his own personal
panic dream: He finds
himself in jail, realizing he
did nothing wrong but
unable to prove it. Nickʼs
nightmares have always
been about being wronged,
about being trapped, a
victim of forces beyond his
control.
He always gets up after
these
dreams,
paces
around the house, then

puts on clothes and goes
outside, wanders along the
roads near our house, into
a park—a Missouri park, a
New York park—going
wherever he wants. He is a
man of the outdoors, if he
is not exactly outdoorsy.
Heʼs not a hiker, a camper,
he doesnʼt know how to
make fires. He wouldnʼt
know how to catch fish
and present them to me.

But he likes the option, he
likes the choice. He wants
to know he can go outside,
even if he chooses instead
to sit on the couch and
watch cage fighting for
three hours.
I do wonder about the
little slut. Andie. I thought
sheʼd last exactly three
days. Then she wouldnʼt
be able to resist sharing. I
know she likes to share

because Iʼm one of her
friends on Facebook—my
profile name is invented
(Madeleine Elster, ha!), my
photo is stolen from a
popup ad for mortgages
(blond, smiling, benefiting
from
historically
low
interest
rates).
Four
months ago, Madeleine
randomly asked to be
Andieʼs friend, and Andie,
like a hapless puppy,

accepted, so I know the
little girl fairly well, along
with all her minutiaeenthralled friends, who
take many naps and love
Greek yogurt and pinot
grigio and enjoy sharing
that with one another.
Andie is a good girl,
meaning she doesnʼt post
photos
of
herself
“partying,” and she never
posts lascivious messages.

Which
is
unfortunate.
When sheʼs exposed as
Nickʼs girlfriend, Iʼd prefer
the media find photos of
her doing shots or kissing
girls or flashing her thong;
this would more easily
cement
her
as
the
homewrecker she is.
Homewrecker.
My
home was disheveled but
not yet wrecked when she
first started kissing my

husband, reaching inside
his trousers, slipping into
bed with him. Taking his
cock in her mouth, all the
way to the root so he feels
extra big as she gags.
Taking it in her ass, deep.
Taking cum shots to the
face and tits, then licking
it
off,
yum.
Taking,
definitely taking. Her type
would.
Theyʼve
been
together for over a year.

Every holiday. I went
through his credit-card
statements (the real ones)
to see what he got her for
Christmas, but heʼs been
shockingly
careful.
I
wonder what it feels like
to be a woman whose
Christmas present must be
bought in cash. Liberating.
Being an undocumented
girl means being the girl
who doesnʼt have to call

the plumber or listen to
gripes about work or
remind and remind him to
pick up some goddamn cat
food.
I need her to break. I
need 1) Noelle to tell
someone
about
my
pregnancy; 2) the police to
find the diary; 3) Andie to
tell someone about the
affair. I suppose I had her
stereotyped—that a girl

who posts updates on her
life five times a day for
anyone to see would have
no real understanding of
what a secret is. Sheʼs
made occasional grazing
mentions of my husband
online:
Saw Mr. Hunky today.
(Oh, do tell!)
(When do we get to
meet this stud?)
(Bridget likes this!)

A kiss from a dreamy
guy makes everything
better.
(Too true!)
(When do we get to
meet Dreamy?!)
(Bridget likes this!)
But
sheʼs
been
surprisingly discreet for a
girl of her generation.
Sheʼs a good girl (for a
cunt). I can picture her,
that heart-shaped face

tilted to one side, the
gently furrowed brow. I
just want you to know Iʼm
on your side, Nick. Iʼm here
for you. Probably baked
him cookies.
The
Ellen
Abbott
cameras are now panning
the
Volunteer
Center,
which looks a little
shabby. A correspondent is
talking about how my
disappearance has “rocked

this tiny town,” and
behind her, I can see a
table
lined
with
homemade casseroles and
cakes for poor Nicky. Even
now the asshole has
women taking care of him.
Desperate women spotting
an opening. A goodlooking, vulnerable man—
and fine, he may have
killed his wife, but we
donʼt know that. Not for

sure. For now itʼs a relief
just to have a man to cook
for, the fortysomething
equivalent of driving your
bike past the cute boyʼs
house.
They
are
showing
Nickʼs grinning cell-phone
photo again. I can picture
the townie slut in her
lonely, glistening kitchen
—a trophy kitchen bought
with alimony money—

mixing and baking while
having
an
imaginary
conversation with Nick:
No, Iʼm forty-three, actually.
No, really, I am! No, I donʼt
have men swarming all over
me, I really donʼt, the men
in
town
arenʼt
that
interesting, most of them …
I get a burst of jealousy
toward that woman with
her cheek against my
husbandʼs. She is prettier

than me as I am now. I eat
Hershey bars and float in
the pool for hours under a
hot sun, the chlorine
turning my flesh rubbery
as a sealʼs. Iʼm tan, which
Iʼve never been before—at
least not a dark, proud,
deep tan. A tanned skin is
a damaged skin, and no
one likes a wrinkled girl; I
spent my life slick with
SPF. But I let myself

darken a bit before I
disappeared, and now, five
days in, Iʼm on my way to
brown. “Brown as a berry!”
old Dorothy, the manager,
says. “You are brown as a
berry, girl!” she says with
delight when I come in to
pay next weekʼs rent in
cash.
I have dark skin, my
mouse-colored helmet cut,
the smart-girl glasses. I

gained twelve pounds in
the months before my
disappearance—carefully
hidden
in
roomy
sundresses, not that my
inattentive husband would
notice—and
already
another two pounds since.
I was careful to have no
photos taken of me in the
months
before
I
disappeared, so the public
will know only pale, thin

Amy. I am definitely not
that anymore. I can feel
my
bottom
move
sometimes, on its own,
when I walk. A wiggle and
a jiggle, wasnʼt that some
old saying? I never had
either before. My body
was a beautiful, perfect
economy, every feature
calibrated, everything in
balance. I donʼt miss it. I
donʼt miss men looking at

me. Itʼs a relief to walk
into a convenience store
and walk right back out
without some hangabout
in
sleeveless
flannel
leering as I leave, some
muttered bit of misogyny
slipping from him like a
nacho-cheese burp. Now
no one is rude to me, but
no one is nice to me either.
No one goes out of their
way, not overly, not really,

not the way they used to.
I am the opposite of
Amy.

NICK DUNNE
EIGHT
DAYS
GONE

As the sun came up, I
held an ice cube to my
cheek. Hours later, and I
could still feel the bite:

two little staple-shaped
creases. I couldnʼt go after
Andie—a worse risk than
her wrath—so I finally
phoned her. Voice mail.
Contain, this must be
contained.
“Andie, I am so sorry, I
donʼt know what to do, I
donʼt know whatʼs going
on. Please forgive me.
Please.”
I shouldnʼt have left a

voice mail, but then I
thought: She may have
hundreds of my voice mails
saved, for all I know. Good
God, if she played a hit list
of the raunchiest, nastiest,
smittenist … any woman
on any jury would send me
away just for that. Itʼs one
thing to know Iʼm a cheat
and another to hear my
heavy teacher voice telling
a young co-ed about my

giant, hard—
I blushed in the dawn
light. The ice cube melted.
I sat on Goʼs front
steps,
began
phoning
Andie every ten minutes,
got
nothing.
I
was
sleepless,
my
nerves
barbwired, when Boney
pulled into the driveway at
6:12 A.M. I said nothing as
she walked toward me,
bearing two Styrofoam

cups.
“Hey, Nick, I brought
you some coffee. Just
came over to check on
you.”
“I bet.”
“I
know
youʼre
probably reeling. From the
news about the pregnancy.
She made an elaborate
show of pouring two
creamers into my coffee,
the way I like it, and

handed it to me. “Whatʼs
that?” she said, pointing to
my cheek.
“What do you mean?”
“I mean, Nick, what is
wrong with your face?
Thereʼs a giant pink …”
She leaned in closer,
grabbed my chin. “Itʼs like
a bite mark.”
“It must be hives. I get
hives when Iʼm stressed.”
“Mm-hmmm.”
She

stirred her coffee. “You do
know Iʼm on your side,
right, Nick?”
“Right.”
“I am. Truly. I wish
youʼd trust me. I just—Iʼm
getting to the point where
I wonʼt be able to help you
if you donʼt trust me. I
know that sounds like a
cop line, but itʼs the truth.”
We sat in a strange
semi-companionable

silence, sipping coffee.
“Hey, so I wanted you
to know before you hear it
anywhere,”
she
said
brightly. “We found Amyʼs
purse.”
“What?”
“Yep, no cash left, but
her ID, cell phone. In
Hannibal, of all places. On
the banks of the river,
south of the steamboat
landing.
Our
guess:

Someone wanted to make
it look like itʼd been tossed
in the river by the perp on
the way out of town,
heading over the bridge
into Illinois.”
“Make it look like?”
“It had never been fully
submerged.
There
are
fingerprints still at the top,
near the zipper. Now
sometimes fingerprints can
hold on even in water,

but … Iʼll spare you the
science, Iʼll just say, the
theory is, this purse was
kinda settled on the banks
to make sure it was
found.”
“Sounds like youʼre
telling me this for a
reason,” I said.
“The fingerprints we
found were yours, Nick.
Which isnʼt that crazy—
men get into their wivesʼ

purses all the time. But
still—” She laughed as if
she got a great idea. “I
gotta ask: You havenʼt
been to Hannibal recently,
have you?”
She said it with such
casual confidence, I had a
flash: a police tracker
hidden somewhere in the
undercarriage of my car,
released
to
me
the
morning
I
went
to

Hannibal.
“Why, exactly, would I
go to Hannibal to get rid
of my wifeʼs purse?”
“Say youʼd killed your
wife and staged the crime
scene in your home, trying
to get us to think she was
attacked by an outsider.
But then you realized we
were beginning to suspect
you, so you wanted to
plant something to get us

to look outside again.
Thatʼs the theory. But at
this point, some of my
guys are so sure you did it,
theyʼd find any theory that
fit. So let me help you:
You in Hannibal lately?”
I shook my head. “You
need to talk to my lawyer.
Tanner Bolt.”
“Tanner Bolt? You sure
thatʼs the way you want to
go, Nick? I feel like weʼve

been pretty fair with you
so far, pretty open. Bolt,
heʼs a … heʼs a last-ditch
guy. Heʼs the guy guilty
people call in.”
“Huh. Well, Iʼm clearly
your lead suspect, Rhonda.
I have to look out for
myself.”
“Letʼs all get together
when he gets in, okay?
Talk this through.”
“Definitely—thatʼs our

plan.”
“A man with a plan,”
Boney said. “Iʼll look
forward to it.” She stood
up, and as she walked
away, she called back:
“Witch hazelʼs good for
hives.”
An hour later, the
doorbell rang, and Tanner
Bolt stood there in a babyblue suit, and something
told me it was the look he

wore when he went “down
South.” He was inspecting
the neighborhood, eyeing
the cars in the driveways,
assessing the houses. He
reminded me of the
Elliotts, in a way—
examining and analyzing
at all times. A brain with
no off switch.
“Show me,” Tanner
said before I could greet
him. “Point me toward the

shed—do not come with
me, and do not go near it
again. Then youʼll tell me
everything.”
We settled down at the
kitchen table—me, Tanner,
and a just-woken Go,
huddling over her first cup
of coffee. I spread out all
of Amyʼs clues like some
awful tarot-card reader.
Tanner leaned toward
me, his neck muscles

tense. “Okay, Nick, make
your case,” he said. “Your
wife
orchestrated
this
whole thing. Make the
case!” He jabbed his index
finger on the table.
“Because Iʼm not moving
forward with my dick in
one hand and a wild story
about a frame-up in the
other. Unless you convince
me. Unless it works.”
I took a deep breath

and gathered my thoughts.
I was always better at
writing
than
talking.
“Before we start,” I said,
“you have to understand
one very key thing about
Amy: She is fucking
brilliant. Her brain is so
busy, it never works on
just one level. Sheʼs like
this endless archaeological
dig: You think youʼve
reached the final layer,

and then you bring down
your pick one more time,
and you break through to
a whole new mine shaft
beneath. With a maze of
tunnels and bottomless
pits.”
“Fine,” Tanner said.
“So …”
“The second thing you
need to know about Amy
is, she is righteous. She is
one of those people who is

never wrong, and she loves
to teach lessons, dole out
punishment.”
“Right, fine, so …”
“Let me tell you a
story, one quick story.
About three years ago, we
were
driving
up
to
Massachusetts.
It
was
awful, road-rage traffic,
and this trucker flipped
Amy off—she wouldnʼt let
him in—and then he

zoomed up and cut her off.
Nothing dangerous, but
really scary for a second.
You know those signs on
the back of trucks: How
Am I Driving? She had me
call and give them the
license plate. I thought
that was the end of it. Two
months later—two months
later—I walked into our
bedroom, and Amy was on
the phone, repeating that

license plate. She had a
whole story: She was
traveling with her twoyear-old, and the driver
had nearly run her off the
road. She said it was her
fourth call. She said sheʼd
even
researched
the
companyʼs routes so she
could pick the correct
highways for her fake
near-accidents.
She
thought of everything. She

was really proud. She was
going to get that guy
fired.”
“Jesus,
Nick,”
Go
muttered.
“Thatʼs
a
very … enlightening story,
Nick,” Tanner said.
“Itʼs just an example.”
“So, now, help me put
this all together,” he said.
“Amy finds out youʼre
cheating. She fakes her

death. She makes the
supposed crime scene look
just fishy enough to raise
eyebrows. Sheʼs screwed
you over with the credit
cards
and
the
life
insurance and your little
man-cave situation out
back …”
“She picks an argument
with me the night before
she goes missing, and she
does it standing near an

open window so our
neighbor will hear.”
“What
was
the
argument?”
“I am a selfish asshole.
Basically, the same one we
always have. What our
neighbor doesnʼt hear is
Amy apologizing later—
because Amy doesnʼt want
her to hear that. I mean, I
remember
being
astonished, because it was

the quickest makeup weʼve
ever had. By the morning
she was freakinʼ making
me crepes, for crying out
loud.”
I saw her again at the
stove, licking powdered
sugar off her thumb,
humming to herself, and I
pictured me, walking over
to her and shaking her
until—
“Okay, and the treasure

hunt?”
Tanner
said.
“Whatʼs the theory there?”
Each clue was unfolded
on the table. Tanner
picked up a few and let
them drop.
“Those are all just
bonus fuck-yous,” I said. “I
know my wife, believe me.
She knew she had to do a
treasure hunt or it would
look fishy. So she does it,
and of course it has

eighteen
different
meanings. Look at the first
clue.”
I picture myself
as your student,
With a teacher so
handsome and wise
My mind opens
up (not to mention my
thighs!)
If I were your
pupil, thereʼd be no
need for flowers

Maybe just a
naughty
appointment
during your office hours
So hurry up, get
going, please do
And this time Iʼll
teach you a thing or
two.
“Itʼs pure Amy. I read
this, I think: Hey, my wife
is flirting with me. No. Sheʼs
actually
referring
to
my … infidelity with

Andie. Fuck-you number
one. So I go there, to my
office, with Gilpin, and
whatʼs waiting for me? A
pair
of
womenʼs
underwear. Not even close
to Amyʼs size—the cops
kept asking everyone what
size Amy wore, I couldnʼt
figure out why.”
“But Amy had no way
of knowing Gilpin would
be with you.” Tanner

frowned.
“Itʼs a damn good bet,”
Go interrupted. “Clue One
was part of the actual crime
scene—so the cops would
know about it—and she
has the words office hours
right in it. Itʼs logical
theyʼd go there, with or
without Nick.”
“So whose panties are
they?” Tanner asked. Go
squinched her nose at the

word panties.
“Who knows?” I said.
“Iʼd assumed they were
Andieʼs, but … Amy
probably just bought them.
The main point is theyʼre
not Amyʼs size. They lead
anyone
to
believe
something inappropriate
happened in my office
with someone who is not
my wife. Fuck-you number
two.”

“And if the cops
werenʼt with you when
you went to the office?”
Tanner asked. “Or no one
noticed the panties?”
“She
doesnʼt
care,
Tanner!
This
treasure
hunt, itʼs as much for her
amusement as anything.
She doesnʼt need it. Sheʼs
overdone it all just to
make sure there are a
million damning little

clues in circulation. Again,
youʼve got to know my
wife: Sheʼs a belt-andsuspenders type.”
“Okay.
Clue
Two,”
Tanner said.
Picture me: Iʼm
crazy about you
My future is
anything but hazy with
you
You took me here
so I could hear you chat

About your
boyhood
adventures:
crummy jeans and visor
hat
Screw everyone
else, for us theyʼre all
ditched
And letʼs sneak a
kiss … pretend we just
got hitched.
“This is Hannibal,” I
said. “Amy and I visited
there once, so thatʼs how I

read it, but itʼs also
another place where I
had … relations with
Andie.”
“And you didnʼt get a
red flag?” Tanner said.
“No, not yet, I was too
moony about the notes
Amy had written me. God,
the girl knows me cold.
She knows exactly what I
want to hear. You are
brilliant. You are witty. And

how fun for her to know
that she could fuck with
my head like that still.
Long-distance, even. I
mean, I was … Christ, I
was practically falling in
love with her again.”
My throat hitched for a
moment. The goofy story
about her friend Insleyʼs
half-dressed,
disgusting
baby. Amy knew that was
what I had loved most

about us back when I
loved us: not the big
moments,
not
the
Romantic with capital-R
moments, but our secret
inside jokes. And now she
was using them all against
me.
“And guess what?” I
said. “They just found
Amyʼs purse in Hannibal.
Iʼm sure as hell someone
can place me there. Hell, I

paid for my tour ticket
with my credit card. So
again, here is this piece of
evidence, and Amy making
sure I can be linked to it.”
“What if no one found
the purse?” Tanner asked.
“Doesnʼt matter,” Go
said. “Sheʼs keeping Nick
running in circles, sheʼs
amusing herself. Iʼm sure
she
was
happy
just
knowing what a guilt trip

it must be for Nick to be
reading all these sweet
notes when he knows heʼs
a cheat and sheʼs gone
missing.”
I tried not to wince at
her disgusted tone: cheat.
“What if Gilpin were
still with Nick when he
went to Hannibal?” Tanner
persisted. “What if Gilpin
were with Nick the whole
time, so he knew that Nick

didnʼt plant the purse
then?”
“Amy knows me well
enough to know Iʼd ditch
Gilpin. She knows I
wouldnʼt want a stranger
watching me read this
stuff,
gauging
my
reactions.”
“Really? How do you
know that?”
“I just do.” I shrugged. I
knew, I just knew.

“Clue Three,” I said,
and
pushed
it
into
Tannerʼs hand.
Maybe you feel
guilty for bringing me
here
I must admit it
felt a bit queer
But itʼs not like
we had the choice of
many a place
We made the
decision: We made this

our space.
Letʼs take our
love to this little brown
house
Gimme some
goodwill, you hot lovinʼ
spouse!
“See, I misread this,
thinking that bringing me
here meant Carthage, but
again, sheʼs referring to
my fatherʼs house, and—”
“Itʼs yet another place

where you fucked this
Andie girl,” Tanner said.
He turned to my sister.
“Pardon the vulgarity.”
Go gave a no-problem
flick of her hand.
Tanner continued: “So,
Nick.
There
are
incriminating
womenʼs
panties in your office,
where you fucked Andie,
and
there
is
Amyʼs
incriminating purse in

Hannibal,
where
you
fucked Andie, and there is
an incriminating treasure
trove of secret credit-card
purchases
in
the
woodshed, where you
fucked Andie.”
“Uh, yeah. Yes, thatʼs
right.”
“So whatʼs at your
dadʼs house?”

AMY ELLIOTT
DUNNE
SEVEN DAYS
GONE

Iʼm pregnant! Thank
you, Noelle Hawthorne,
the world knows it now,
you little idiot. In the day

since she pulled her stunt
at my vigil (I do wish she
hadnʼt upstaged my vigil,
though—ugly girls can be
such thunder stealers), the
hatred against Nick has
ballooned. I wonder if he
can breathe with all that
fury building around him.
I knew the key to bigtime coverage, round-theclock, frantic, bloodlust
never-ending Ellen Abbott

coverage, would be the
pregnancy. Amazing Amy
is tempting as is. Amazing
Amy knocked up is
irresistible. Americans like
what is easy, and itʼs easy
to like pregnant women—
theyʼre like ducklings or
bunnies or dogs. Still, it
baffles me that these selfrighteous, self-enthralled
waddlers get such special
treatment. As if itʼs so hard

to spread your legs and let
a man ejaculate between
them.
You know what is
hard? Faking a pregnancy.
Pay attention, because
this is impressive. It
started with my vacantbrained friend Noelle. The
Midwest is full of these
types of people: the niceenoughs. Nice enough but
with a soul made of plastic

—easy to mold, easy to
wipe down. The womanʼs
entire music collection is
formed from Pottery Barn
compilations.
Her
bookshelves are stocked
with coffee-table crap: The
Irish in America. Mizzou
Football: A History in
Pictures. We Remember
9/11. Something Dumb with
Kittens. I knew I needed a
pliant friend for my plan,

someone I could load up
with awful stories about
Nick, someone who would
become overly attached to
me, someone whoʼd be
easy to manipulate, who
wouldnʼt think too hard
about anything I said
because she felt privileged
to hear it. Noelle was the
obvious choice, and when
she told me she was
pregnant
again—triplets

werenʼt
enough,
apparently—I realized I
could be pregnant too.
A search online: how to
drain your toilet for repair.
Noelle
invited
for
lemonade.
Lots
of
lemonade.
Noelle peeing in my
drained, unflushable toilet,
each of us so terribly
embarrassed!
Me, a small glass jar,

the pee in my toilet going
into the glass jar.
Me, a well-laid history
of needle/blood phobia.
Me, the glass jar of pee
hidden in my purse, a
doctorʼs appointment (oh,
I canʼt do a blood test, I
have a total phobia of
needles … urine test,
thatʼll do fine, thank you).
Me, a pregnancy on my
medical record.

Me, running to Noelle
with the good news.
Perfect.
Nick
gets
another motive, I get to be
sweet missing pregnant
lady, my parents suffer
even more, Ellen Abbott
canʼt resist. Honestly, it
was thrilling to be selected
finally, officially for Ellen
among all the hundreds of
other cases. Itʼs sort of like
a talent competition: You

do the best you can, and
then itʼs out of your hands,
itʼs up to the judges.
And, oh, does she hate
Nick and love me. I wished
my parents werenʼt getting
such special treatment,
though. I watch them on
the news coverage, my
mom thin and reedy, the
cords in her neck like
spindly tree branches,
always flexed. I see my

dad grown ruddy with
fear, the eyes a little too
wide, the smile squared.
Heʼs a handsome man,
usually, but heʼs beginning
to look like a caricature, a
possessed clown doll. I
know I should feel sorry
for them, but I donʼt. Iʼve
never been more to them
than a symbol anyway, the
walking ideal. Amazing
Amy in the flesh. Donʼt

screw up, you are Amazing
Amy. Our only one. There
is an unfair responsibility
that comes with being an
only child—you grow up
knowing
you
arenʼt
allowed to disappoint,
youʼre not even allowed to
die.
There
isnʼt
a
replacement
toddling
around; youʼre it. It makes
you desperate to be
flawless, and it also makes

you drunk with the power.
In such ways are despots
made.
This morning I stroll
over to Dorothyʼs office to
get a soda. Itʼs a tiny
wood-paneled room. The
desk seems to have no
purpose other than holding
Dorothyʼs collection of
snow globes from places
that seem unworthy of
commemoration:
Gulf

Shores, Alabama. Hilo,
Arkansas. When I see the
snow globes, I donʼt see
paradise, I see overheated
hillbillies with sunburns
tugging along wailing,
clumsy children, smacking
them with one hand, with
the other clutching giant
nonbiodegradable
Styrofoam cups of warm
corn-syrupy drinks.
Dorothy has one of

those ʼ70s kitten-in-a-tree
posters—Hang in There!
She posts her poster with
all sincerity. I like to
picture her running into
some
self-impressed
Williamsburg bitch, all
Bettie Page bangs and
pointy glasses, who owns
the same poster ironically.
Iʼd like to listen to them
try to negotiate each other.
Ironic
people
always

dissolve when confronted
with earnestness, itʼs their
kryptonite. Dorothy has
another gem taped to the
wall by the soda machine,
showing a toddler asleep
on the toilet—Too Tired to
Tinkle. Iʼve been thinking
about stealing this one, a
fingernail under the old
yellow tape, while I
distract-chat with Dorothy.
I bet I could get some

decent cash for it on eBay
—Iʼd like to keep some
cash coming in—but I
canʼt do it, because that
would create an electronic
trail, and Iʼve read plenty
about those from my
myriad true-crime books.
Electronic trails are bad:
Donʼt use a cell phone
thatʼs registered to you,
because the cell towers can
ping your location. Donʼt

use your ATM or credit
card. Use only public
computers, well trafficked.
Beware of the number of
cameras that can be on
any given street, especially
near a bank or a busy
intersection or bodegas.
Not that there are any
bodegas down here. There
are no cameras either, in
our cabin complex. I know
—I
asked
Dorothy,

pretending it was a safety
issue.
“Our
clients
arenʼt
exactly Big Brother types,”
she said. “Not that theyʼre
criminals, but they donʼt
usually like to be on the
radar.”
No, they donʼt seem
like theyʼd appreciate that.
Thereʼs my friend Jeff,
who keeps his odd hours
and
returns
with

suspicious amounts of
undocumented fish that he
stores in massive ice
chests. He is literally fishy.
At the far cabin is a couple
who are probably in their
forties,
but
methweathered, so they look at
least sixty. They stay
inside most of the time,
aside
from
occasional
wild-eyed treks to the
laundry
room—darting

across the gravel parking
lot with their clothes in
trash bags, some sort of
tweaky spring cleaning.
Hellohello,
they
say,
always twice with two
head nods, then continue
on their way. The man
sometimes has a boa
constrictor
wrapped
around his neck, though
the
snake
is
never
acknowledged, by me or

him. In addition to these
regulars, a goodly amount
of single women straggle
through,
usually
with
bruises.
Some
seem
embarrassed,
others
horribly sad.
One
moved
in
yesterday, a blond girl,
very young, with brown
eyes and a split lip. She sat
on her front porch—the
cabin next to mine—

smoking a cigarette, and
when we caught each
otherʼs eye, she sat up
straight, proud, her chin
jutted out. No apology in
her. I thought: I need to be
like her. I will make a study
of her: She is who I can be
for a bit—the abused tough
girl hiding out until the
storm passes over.
After a few hours of
morning TV—scanning for

any news on the Amy
Elliott Dunne case—I slip
into my clammy bikini. Iʼll
go to the pool. Float a bit,
take a vacation from my
harpy
brain.
The
pregnancy
news
was
gratifying, but there is still
so much I donʼt know. I
planned so hard, but there
are things beyond my
control, spoiling my vision
of how this should go.

Andie hasnʼt done her
part. The diary may need
some help being found.
The police havenʼt made a
move to arrest Nick. I
donʼt know what theyʼve
all discovered, and I donʼt
like it. Iʼm tempted to
make a call, a tip-line call,
to nudge them in the right
direction. Iʼll wait a few
more days. I have a
calendar on my wall, and I

mark three days from now
with the words CALL
TODAY. So I know thatʼs
how long Iʼve agreed to
wait. Once they find the
diary, things will move
quickly.
Outside, itʼs jungle-hot
once again, the cicadas
closing in. My inflatable
raft is pink with mermaids
on it and too small for me
—my calves dangle in the

water—but it keeps me
floating aimlessly for a
good hour, which is
something Iʼve learned “I”
like to do.
I can see a blond head
bobbing across the parking
lot, and then the girl with
the split lip comes through
the chain-link gate with
one of the bath towels
from the cabins, no bigger
than a tea towel, and a

pack of Merits and a book
and SPF 120. Lung cancer
but not skin. She settles
herself and applies the
lotion carefully, which is
different from the other
beat-up women who come
here—they
slather
themselves in baby oil,
leave greasy shadows on
the lawn chairs.
The girl nods to me,
the nod men give each

other when they sit down
at a bar. She is reading The
Martian Chronicles by Ray
Bradbury. A sci-fi girl.
Abused
women
like
escapism, of course.
“Good book,” I toss
over to her, a harmless
conversational beach ball.
“Someone left it in my
cabin. It was this or Black
Beauty.” She puts on fat,
cheap sunglasses.

“Not bad either. Black
Stallionʼs better, though.”
She looks up at me
with sunglasses still on.
Two black bee-eyed discs.
“Hunh.”
She turns back to her
book, the pointed I am now
reading gesture usually
seen on crowded airplanes.
And I am the annoying
busybody next to her who
hogs the armrest and says

things like “Business or
pleasure?”
“Iʼm Nancy,” I say. A
new name—not Lydia—
which isnʼt smart in these
cramped quarters, but it
comes out. My brain
sometimes goes too fast for
my own good. I was
thinking of the girlʼs split
lip, her sad, pre-owned
vibe, and then I was
thinking of abuse and

prostitution, and then I
was thinking of Oliver!, my
favorite musical as a child,
and the doomed hooker
Nancy, who loved her
violent man right until he
killed her, and then I was
wondering
why
my
feminist mother and I ever
watched
Oliver!,
considering “As Long as He
Needs Me” is basically a
lilting paean to domestic

violence, and then I was
thinking that Diary Amy
was also killed by her
man, she was actually a lot
like—
“Iʼm Nancy,” I say.
“Greta.”
Sounds made up.
“Nice to meet you,
Greta.”
I float away. Behind me
I hear the shwick of
Gretaʼs lighter, and then

smoke wafts overhead like
spindrifts.
Forty minutes later,
Greta sits down on the
edge of the pool, dangles
her legs in the water. “Itʼs
hot,” she says. “The
water.” She has a husky,
hardy voice, cigarettes and
prairie dirt.
“Like bathwater.”
“Itʼs
not
very
refreshing.”

“The lakeʼs not much
cooler.”
“I canʼt swim anyway,”
she says.
Iʼve never met anyone
who canʼt swim. “I can just
barely,”
I
lie.
“Dog
paddle.”
She ruffles her legs, the
waves gently rocking my
raft. “So whatʼs it like
here?” she asks.
“Nice. Quiet.”

“Good, thatʼs what I
need.”
I turn to look at her.
She
has
two
gold
necklaces,
a
perfectly
round bruise the size of a
plum near her left breast,
and a shamrock tattoo just
above her bikini line. Her
swimsuit is brand-new,
cherry-red, cheap. From
the marina convenience
store where I bought my

raft.
“You on your own?” I
ask.
“Very.”
I am unsure what to
ask next. Is there some sort
of code that abused
women use with each
other, a language I donʼt
know?
“Guy trouble?”
She
twitches
an
eyebrow at me that seems

to be a yes. “Me too,” I say.
“Itʼs not like we
werenʼt warned,” she says.
She cups her hand into the
water, lets it dribble down
her front. “My mom, one
of the first things she ever
told me, going to school
the first day: Stay away
from boys. Theyʼll either
throw rocks or look up your
skirt.”
“You should make a T-

shirt that says that.”
She laughs. “Itʼs true,
though. Itʼs always true.
My mom lives in a lesbian
village down in Texas. I
keep thinking I should join
her. Everyone seems happy
there.”
“A lesbian village?”
“Like
a,
a
whaddayacallit.
A
commune.
Bunch
of
lesbians
bought
land,

started their own society,
sort of. No men allowed.
Sounds just freakinʼ great
to me, world without
men.” She cups another
handful of water, pulls up
her sunglasses, and wets
her face. “Too bad I donʼt
like pussy.”
She laughs, an old
womanʼs
angry-bark
laugh. “So, are there any
asshole guys here I can

start dating?” she says.
“Thatʼs my, like, pattern.
Run away from one, bump
into the next.”
“Itʼs half empty most of
the time. Thereʼs Jeff, the
guy with the beard, heʼs
actually really nice,” I say.
“Heʼs been here longer
than me.”
“How long are you
staying?” she asks.
I pause. Itʼs odd, I donʼt

know the exact amount of
time I will be here. I had
planned on staying until
Nick was arrested, but I
have no idea if he will be
arrested soon.
“Till he stops looking
for you, huh?” Greta
guesses.
“Something like that.”
She
examines
me
closely,
frowns.
My
stomach tightens. I wait

for her to say it: You look
familiar.
“Never go back to a
man with fresh bruises.
Donʼt
give
him
the
satisfaction,”
Greta
intones. She stands up,
gathers her things. Dries
her legs on the tiny towel.
“Good day killed,” she
says.
For some reason, I give
a thumbs-up, which Iʼve

never done in my life.
“Come to my cabin
when you get out, if you
want to,” she says. “We
can watch TV.”
I bring a fresh tomato
from Dorothy, held in my
palm
like
a
shiny
housewarming gift. Greta
comes to the door and
barely acknowledges me,
as if Iʼve been dropping
over for years. She plucks

the tomato from my hand.
“Perfect, I was just
making sandwiches,” she
says. “Grab a seat.” She
points toward the bed—we
have no sitting rooms here
—and moves into her
kitchenette, which has the
same plastic cutting board,
the same dull knife, as
mine. She slices the
tomato. A plastic disc of
lunch meat sits on the

counter, the stomachysweet smell filling the
room.
She
sets
two
slippery sandwiches on
paper plates, along with
handfuls
of
goldfish
crackers, and marches
them into the bedroom
area, her hand already on
the remote, flipping from
noise to noise. We sit on
the edge of the bed, side
by side, watching the TV.

“Stop me if you see
something,” Greta says.
I take a bite of my
sandwich. My tomato slips
out the side and onto my
thigh.
The Beverly Hillbillies,
Suddenly
Susan,
Armageddon.
Ellen Abbott Live. A
photo of me fills the
screen. I am the lead story.
Again. I look great.

“You seen this?” Greta
asked, not looking at me,
talking
as
if
my
disappearance
were
a
rerun of a decent TV show.
“This woman vanishes on
her five-year wedding
anniversary. Husband acts
real weird from the start,
all smiley and shit. Turns
out he bumped up her life
insurance, and they just
found out the wife was

pregnant. And the guy
didnʼt want it.”
The screen cuts to
another photo of me
juxtaposed with Amazing
Amy.
Greta turns to me. “You
remember those books?”
“Of course!”
“You like those books?”
“Everyone likes those
books, theyʼre so cute,” I
say.

Greta snorts. “Theyʼre
so fake.” Close-up of me.
I wait for her to say
how beautiful I am.
“Sheʼs not bad, huh,
for, like, her age,” she
says. “I hope I look that
good when Iʼm forty.”
Ellen is filling the
audience in on my story;
my photo lingers on the
screen.
“Sounds to me like she

was a spoiled rich girl,”
Greta
says.
“Highmaintenance. Bitchy.”
That is simply unfair.
Iʼd left no evidence for
anyone to conclude that.
Since
Iʼd
moved
to
Missouri—well, since Iʼd
come up with my plan—
Iʼd been careful to be lowmaintenance, easygoing,
cheerful, all those things
people want women to be.

I waved to neighbors, I ran
errands for Moʼs friends, I
once brought cola to the
ever-soiled Stucks Buckley.
I visited Nickʼs dad so that
all the nurses could testify
to how nice I was, so I
could whisper over and
over into Bill Dunneʼs
spiderweb brain: I love you,
come live with us, I love you,
come live with us. Just to
see if it would catch.

Nickʼs dad is what the
people of Comfort Hill call
a roamer—he is always
wandering off. I love the
idea of Bill Dunne, the
living totem of everything
Nick fears he could
become, the object of
Nickʼs
most
profound
despair, showing up over
and over and over on our
doorstep.
“How does she seem

bitchy?” I ask.
She shrugs. The TV
goes to a commercial for
air freshener. A woman is
spraying air freshener so
her family will be happy.
Then to a commercial for
very thin panty liners so a
woman can wear a dress
and dance and meet the
man she will later spray
air freshener for.
Clean and bleed. Bleed

and clean.
“You can just tell,”
Greta says. “She just
sounds like a rich, bored
bitch. Like those rich
bitches who use their
husbandsʼ money to start,
like, cupcake companies
and card shops and shit.
Boutiques.”
In New York, I had
friends with all those kinds
of businesses—they liked

to be able to say they
worked, even though they
only did the little stuff that
was
fun:
Name
the
cupcake,
order
the
stationery,
wear
the
adorable dress that was
from their very own store.
“Sheʼs definitely one of
those,” Greta said. “Rich
bitch putting on airs.”
Greta leaves to go to
the bathroom, and I tiptoe

into her kitchen, go into
her fridge, and spit in her
milk, her orange juice, and
a container of potato
salad, then tiptoe back to
the bed.
Flush. Greta returns. “I
mean, all that doesnʼt
mean itʼs okay that he
killed her. Sheʼs just
another woman, made a
very bad choice in her
man.”

She is looking right at
me, and I wait for her to
say,
“Hey,
wait
a
minute …”
But she turns back to
the TV, rearranges herself
so she is lying on her
stomach like a child, her
chin in her hands, her face
directed at my image on
the screen.
“Oh, shit, here it goes,”
Greta says. “People are

hatinʼ on this guy.”
The
show
gets
underway, and I feel a bit
better. It is the apotheosis
of Amy.
Campbell MacIntosh,
childhood friend: “Amy is
just a nurturing, motherly
type of woman. She loved
being a wife. And I know
she would have been a
great mother. But Nick—
you just knew Nick was

wrong somehow. Cold and
aloof and really calculating
—you got the feeling that
he was definitely aware of
how much money Amy
had.”
(Campbell is lying: She
got all googly around Nick,
she absolutely adored him.
But Iʼm sure she liked the
idea that he only married
me for my money.)
Shawna Kelly, North

Carthage resident: “I found
it really, really strange
how totally unconcerned
he was at the search for
his wife. He was just, you
know, chatting, passing
the time. Flirting around
with me, who he didnʼt
know from Adam. Iʼd try
to turn the conversation to
Amy, and he would just—
just no interest.”
(Iʼm sure this desperate

old slut absolutely did not
try
to
turn
the
conversation toward me.)
Steven
“Stucks”
Buckley, longtime friend of
Nick Dunne: “She was a
sweetheart. Sweet. Heart.
And Nick? He just didnʼt
seem that worried about
Amy being gone. The guy
was always like that: selfcentered. Stuck-up a little.
Like heʼd made it all big in

New York and we should
all bow down.”
(I
despise
Stucks
Buckley, and what the fuck
kind of name is that?)
Noelle
Hawthorne,
looking like she just got
new highlights: “I think he
killed her. No one will say
it, but I will. He abused
her, and he bullied her,
and he finally killed her.”
(Good dog.)

Greta glances sideways
at me, her cheeks smushed
up under her hands, her
face flickering in the TV
glow.
“I hope thatʼs not true,”
she says. “That he killed
her. Itʼd be nice to think
that maybe she just got
away, just ran away from
him, and sheʼs hiding out
all safe and sound.”
She kicks her legs back

and forth like a lazy
swimmer. I canʼt tell if
sheʼs fucking with me.

NICK DUNNE
EIGHT DAYS
GONE

We searched every
cranny of my fatherʼs
house, which didnʼt take
long,
since
itʼs
so
pathetically empty. The
cabinets, the closets. I

yanked at the corners of
rugs to see if they came
up. I peeked into his
washer and dryer, stuck a
hand up his chimney. I
even looked behind the
toilet tanks.
“Very Godfather
of
you,” Go said.
“If
it
were
very
Godfather, Iʼd have found
what we were looking for
and come out shooting.”

Tanner stood in the
center of my dadʼs living
room and tugged at the
end of his lime tie. Go and
I were smeared with dust
and grime, but somehow
Tannerʼs white buttondown positively glowed, as
if it retained some of the
strobe-light glamour of
New York. He was staring
at the corner of a cabinet,
chewing on his lip, tugging

at the tie, thinking. The
man had probably spent
years perfecting this look:
the Shut up, client, Iʼm
thinking look.
“I donʼt like this,” he
finally said. “We have a lot
of uncontained issues here,
and I wonʼt go to the cops
until weʼre very, very
contained. My first instinct
is to get ahead of the
situation—report that stuff

in the shed before we get
busted with it. But if we
donʼt know what Amy
wants us to find here, and
we donʼt know Andieʼs
mind-set … Nick, do you
have a guess what Andieʼs
mind-set is?”
I shrugged. “Pissed.”
“I mean, that makes me
very, very nervous. Weʼre
in a very prickly situation,
basically. We need to tell

the
cops
about
the
woodshed. We have to be
on the front end of that
discovery. But I want to
lay out for you what will
happen when we do. And
what will happen is: They
will go after Go. Itʼll be
one of two options. One:
Go is your accomplice, she
was helping you hide this
stuff on her property, and
in all likelihood, she

knows you killed Amy.”
“Come on, you canʼt be
serious,” I said.
“Nick, weʼd be lucky
with that version,” Tanner
said. “They can interpret
this however they want.
How about this one: It was
Go
who
stole
your
identity, who got those
credit cards. She bought
all that crap in there. Amy
found out, there was a

confrontation, Go killed
Amy.”
“Then we get way, way
ahead of all this,” I said.
“We tell them about the
woodshed, and we tell
them Amy is framing me.”
“I think that is a bad
idea in general, and right
now itʼs a really bad idea
if we donʼt have Andie on
our side, because weʼd
have to tell them about

Andie.”
“Why?”
“Because if we go to
the cops with your story,
that Amy framed you—”
“Why do you keep
saying my story, like itʼs
something I made up?”
“Ha. Good point. If we
explain to the cops how
Amy is framing you, we
have to explain why she is
framing you. Why: because

she found out you have a
very pretty, very young
girlfriend on the side.”
“Do we really have to
tell them that?” I asked.
“Amy framed you for
her murder because … she
was … what, bored?”
I swallowed my lips.
“We have to give them
Amyʼs motive, it doesnʼt
work otherwise. But the
problem is, if we set

Andie, gift-wrapped, on
their doorstep, and they
donʼt buy the frame-up
theory, then weʼve given
them your motive for
murder. Money problems,
check.
Pregnant
wife,
check. Girlfriend, check.
Itʼs
a
murdererʼs
triumvirate.
Youʼll
go
down. Women will line up
to tear you apart with
their
fingernails.”
He

began pacing. “But if we
donʼt do anything, and
Andie goes to them on her
own …”
“So what do we do?” I
asked.
“I think the cops will
laugh us out of the station
if we say right now that
Amy framed you. Itʼs too
flimsy. I believe you, but
itʼs flimsy.”
“But the treasure hunt

clues—” I started.
“Nick, even I donʼt
understand those clues,”
Go said. “Theyʼre all inside
baseball between you and
Amy. Thereʼs only your
word that theyʼre leading
you into … incriminating
situations.
I
mean,
seriously: crummy jeans
and
visor
equals
Hannibal?”
“Little brown house

equals your dadʼs house,
which is blue,” Tanner
added.
I could feel Tannerʼs
doubt. I needed to really
show him Amyʼs character.
Her
lies,
her
vindictiveness, her scoresettling. I needed other
people to back me up—
that my wife wasnʼt
Amazing Amy but Avenging
Amy.

“Letʼs see if we can
reach out to Andie today,”
Tanner finally said.
“Isnʼt it a risk to wait?”
Go asked.
Tanner nodded. “Itʼs a
risk. We have to move fast.
If another bit of evidence
pops up, if the police get a
search warrant for the
woodshed, if Andie goes to
the cops—”
“She wonʼt,” I said.

“She bit you, Nick.”
“She
wonʼt.
Sheʼs
pissed off right now, but
sheʼs … I canʼt believe
sheʼd do that to me. She
knows Iʼm innocent.”
“Nick, you said you
were with Andie for about
an hour the morning Amy
disappeared, yes?”
“Yes. From about tenthirty to right before
twelve.”

“So where were you
between seven-thirty and
ten?” Tanner asked. “You
said you left the house at
seven-thirty, right? Where
did you go?”
I chewed on my cheek.
“Where did you go,
Nick—I need to know.”
“Itʼs not relevant.”
“Nick!” Go snapped.
“I just did what I do
some
mornings.
I

pretended to leave, then I
drove to the most deserted
part of our complex, and
I … one of the houses
there has an unlocked
garage.”
“And?” Tanner said.
“And
I
read
magazines.”
“Excuse me?”
“I read back issues of
my old magazine.”
I still missed my

magazine—I hid copies
like porn and read them in
secret, because I didnʼt
want anyone feeling sorry
for me.
I looked up, and both
Tanner and Go felt very,
very sorry for me.
I drove back to my
house just after noon, was
greeted by a street full of
news
vans,
reporters

camped out on my lawn. I
couldnʼt get into my
driveway, was forced to
park in front of the house.
I took a breath, then flung
myself out of the car. They
set on me like starving
birds,
pecking
and
fluttering,
breaking
formation and gathering
again. Nick, did you know
Amy was pregnant? Nick,
what is your alibi? Nick, did

you kill Amy?
I made it inside, locked
myself in. On each side of
the door were windows, so
I braved it and quickly
pulled down the shades,
all the while cameras
clicking at me, questions
called. Nick, did you kill
Amy? Once the shades
were pulled, it was like
covering a canary for the
night: The noise out front

stopped.
I went upstairs and
satisfied
my
shower
craving. I closed my eyes
and let the spray dissolve
the dirt from my dadʼs
house. When I opened
them back up, the first
thing I saw was Amyʼs
pink razor on the soap
dish. It felt ominous,
malevolent. My wife was
crazy. I was married to a

crazy woman. Itʼs every
assholeʼs mantra: I married
a psycho bitch. But I got a
small,
nasty
bite
of
gratification: I really did
marry a genuine, bona fide
psycho bitch. Nick, meet
your wife: the worldʼs
foremost mindfucker. I was
not as big an asshole as Iʼd
thought. An asshole, yes,
but not on a grandiose
scale. The cheating, that

had been preemptive, a
subconscious reaction to
five years yoked to a
madwoman: Of course Iʼd
find myself attracted to an
uncomplicated,
goodnatured hometown girl.
Itʼs like when people with
iron deficiencies crave red
meat.
I was toweling off
when the doorbell rang. I
leaned out the bathroom

door and heard the
reportersʼ voices geared up
again: Do you believe your
son-in-law, Marybeth? What
does it feel like to know
youʼll be a grandpa, Rand?
Do you think Nick killed
your daughter, Marybeth?
They stood side by side
on my front step, grimfaced, their backs rigid.
There were about a dozen
journalists, paparazzi, but

they made the noise of
twice that many. Do you
believe your son-in-law,
Marybeth? What does it feel
like to know youʼll be a
grandpa, Rand? The Elliotts
entered with mumbled
hellos and downcast eyes,
and I slammed the door
shut on the cameras. Rand
put a hand on my arm and
immediately removed it
under Marybethʼs gaze.

“Sorry, I was in the
shower.” My hair was still
dripping,
wetting
the
shoulders of my T-shirt.
Marybethʼs
hair
was
greasy, her clothes wilted.
She looked at me like I
was insane.
“Tanner Bolt? Are you
serious?” she asked.
“What do you mean?”
“I mean, Nick: Tanner
Bolt, are you serious. He

only
represents
guilty
people.” She leaned in
closer, grabbed my chin.
“Whatʼs on your cheek?”
“Hives. Stress.” I turned
away from her. “Thatʼs not
true
about
Tanner,
Marybeth. Itʼs not. Heʼs
the best in the business. I
need him right now. The
police—all theyʼre doing is
looking at me.”
“That certainly seems

to be the case,” she said.
“It looks like a bite mark.”
“Itʼs hives.”
Marybeth released an
aggravated sigh, turned
the corner into the living
room. “This is where it
happened?” she asked. Her
face had collapsed into a
series of fleshy ridges—eye
bags and saggy cheeks, her
lips downcast.
“We think. Some sort

of
…
altercation,
confrontation,
also
happened in the kitchen.”
“Because of the blood.”
Marybeth touched the
ottoman, tested it, lifted it
a few inches, and let it
drop. “I wish you hadnʼt
fixed
everything.
You
made it look like nothing
ever happened.”
“Marybeth, he has to
live here,” Rand said.

“I still donʼt understand
how—I mean, what if the
police
didnʼt
find
everything? What if … I
donʼt know. It seems like
they gave up. If they just
let the house go. Open to
anyone.”
“Iʼm sure they got
everything,” Rand said,
and squeezed her hand.
“Why donʼt we ask if we
can look at Amyʼs things

so you can pick something
special, okay?” He glanced
at me. “Would that be all
right, Nick? Itʼd be a
comfort to have something
of hers.” He turned back to
his wife. “That blue
sweater Nana knitted for
her.”
“I donʼt want the
goddamn blue sweater,
Rand!”
She flung his hand off,

began pacing around the
room, picking up items.
She pushed the ottoman
with a toe. “This is the
ottoman, Nick?” she asked.
“The one they said was
flipped
over
but
it
shouldnʼt have been?”
“Thatʼs the ottoman.”
She stopped pacing,
kicked it again, and
watched it remain upright.
“Marybeth, Iʼm sure

Nick is exhausted”—Rand
glanced at me with a
meaningful
smile—“like
we all are. I think we
should do what we came
here for and—”
“This is what I came
here for, Rand. Not some
stupid sweater of Amyʼs to
snuggle up against like Iʼm
three. I want my daughter.
I donʼt want her stuff. Her
stuff means nothing to me.

I want Nick to tell us what
the hell is going on,
because this whole thing is
starting to stink. I never, I
never—I never felt so
foolish in my life.” She
began crying, swiping
away the tears, clearly
furious at herself for
crying. “We trusted you
with our daughter. We
trusted you, Nick. Just tell
us the truth!” She put a

quivering index finger
under my nose. “Is it true?
Did you not want the
baby? Did you not love
Amy anymore? Did you
hurt her?”
I wanted to smack her.
Marybeth and Rand had
raised Amy. She was
literally
their
work
product. They had created
her. I wanted to say the
words Your daughter is the

monster here, but I couldnʼt
—not until weʼd told the
police—and so I remained
dumbfounded, trying to
think of what I could say.
But I looked like I was
stonewalling. “Marybeth, I
would never—”
“I would never, I could
never, thatʼs all I hear from
your goddamn mouth. You
know, I hate even looking
at you anymore. I really

do. Thereʼs something
wrong with you. Thereʼs
something missing inside
you, to act the way youʼve
been acting. Even if it
turns out youʼre totally
blameless, I will never
forgive you for how
casually youʼve taken all
of this. Youʼd think you
mislaid a damn umbrella!
After all Amy gave up for
you, after all she did for

you, and this is what she
gets in return. It— You— I
donʼt believe you, Nick.
Thatʼs what I came here to
let you know. I donʼt
believe
in
you.
Not
anymore.”
She began sobbing,
turned away, and flung
herself out the front door
as the thrilled cameramen
filmed her. She got in the
car, and two reporters

pressed
against
the
window, knocking on it,
trying to get her to say
something. In the living
room, we could hear them
repeating and repeating
her name. Marybeth—
Marybeth—
Rand remained, hands
in his pockets, trying to
figure out what role to
play. Tannerʼs voice—we
have to keep the Elliotts on

our
side—was
Greekchorusing in my ear.
Rand
opened
his
mouth, and I headed him
off. “Rand, tell me what I
can do.”
“Just say it, Nick.”
“Say what?”
“I donʼt want to ask,
and you donʼt want to
answer. I get that. But I
need to hear you say it.
You
didnʼt
kill
our

daughter.”
He laughed and teared
up at the same time. “Jesus
Christ, I canʼt keep my
head straight,” Rand said.
He was turning pink,
flushed, a nuclear sunburn.
“I canʼt figure out how this
is happening. I canʼt figure
it out!” He was still
smiling. A tear dribbled on
his chin and fell to his
shirt collar. “Just say it,

Nick.”
“Rand, I did not kill
Amy or hurt her in any
way.” He kept his eyes on
me. “Do you believe me,
that I didnʼt physically
harm her?”
Rand laughed again.
“You know what I was
about to say? I was about
to say I donʼt know what
to believe anymore. And
then I thought, thatʼs

someone elseʼs line. Thatʼs
a line from a movie, not
something I should be
saying, and I wonder for a
second, am I in a movie?
Can I stop being in this
movie? Then I know I
canʼt. But for a second,
you think, Iʼll say something
different, and this will all
change. But it wonʼt, will
it?”
With one quick Jack

Russell headshake, he
turned and followed his
wife to the car.
Instead of feeling sad, I
felt alarmed. Before the
Elliotts were even out of
my driveway, I was
thinking: We need to go to
the cops quickly, soon.
Before the Elliotts started
discussing their loss of
faith in public. I needed to
prove my wife was not

who she pretended to be.
Not Amazing Amy: Avenging
Amy. I flashed to Tommy
OʼHara—the guy who
called the tip line three
times, the guy Amy had
accused of raping her.
Tanner had gotten some
background on him: He
wasnʼt the macho Irishman
Iʼd pictured from his
name, not a firefighter or
cop. He wrote for a humor

website based in Brooklyn,
a decent one, and his
contributor photo revealed
him to be a scrawny guy
with dark-framed glasses
and an uncomfortable
amount of thick black hair,
wearing a wry grin and a
T-shirt for a band called
the Bingos.
He picked up on the
first ring. “Yeah?”
“This is Nick Dunne.

You called me about my
wife. Amy Dunne. Amy
Elliott. I have to talk with
you.”
I heard a pause, waited
for him to hang up on me
like Hilary Handy.
“Call me back in ten
minutes.”
I did. The background
was a bar, I knew the
sound well enough: the
murmur of drinkers, the

clatter of ice cubes, the
strange pops of noise as
people called for drinks or
hailed friends. I had a
burst of homesickness for
my own place.
“Okay, thanks,” he said.
“Had to get to a bar.
Seemed like a Scotch
conversation.” His voice
got progressively closer,
thicker: I could picture
him huddling protectively

over a drink, cupping his
mouth to the phone.
“So,” I began, “I got
your messages.”
“Right.
Sheʼs
still
missing, right? Amy?”
“Yes.”
“Can I ask you what
you think has happened?”
he said. “To Amy?”
Fuck it, I wanted a
drink. I went into my
kitchen—next best thing to

my
bar—and
poured
myself one. Iʼd been trying
to be more careful about
the booze, but it felt so
good: the tang of a Scotch,
a dark room with the
blinding sun right outside.
“Can I ask you why you
called?” I replied.
“Iʼve been watching the
coverage,” he said. “Youʼre
fucked.”
“I am. I wanted to talk

to you because I thought it
was … interesting that
youʼd try to get in touch.
Considering. The rape
charge.”
“Ah, you know about
that,” he said.
“I know there was a
rape charge, but I donʼt
necessarily believe youʼre
a rapist. I wanted to hear
what you had to say.”
“Yeah.” I heard him

take a gulp of his Scotch,
kill it, shake the ice cubes
around. “I caught the story
on the news one night.
Your story. Amyʼs. I was in
bed, eating Thai. Minding
my own business. Totally
fucked me in the head. Her
after all these years.” He
called to the bartender for
another. “So my lawyer
said no way I should talk
to you, but … what can I

say? Iʼm too fucking nice. I
canʼt let you twist. God, I
wish you could still smoke
in bars. This is a Scotch
and
cigarette
conversation.”
“Tell me,” I said.
“About the assault charge.
The rape.”
“Like I said, man, Iʼve
seen the coverage, the
media is shitting all over
you. I mean, youʼre the

guy. So I should leave well
enough alone—I donʼt
need that girl back in my
life.
Even,
like,
tangentially. But shit. I
wish someone had done
me the favor.”
“So do me the favor,” I
said.
“First of all, she
dropped the charges—you
know that, right?”
“I know. Did you do

it?”
“Fuck you. Of course I
didnʼt do it. Did you do
it?”
“No.”
“Well.”
Tommy called again for
his Scotch. “Let me ask:
Your marriage was good?
Amy was happy?”
I stayed silent.
“You donʼt have to
answer, but Iʼm going to

guess no. Amy was not
happy.
For
whatever
reason. Iʼm not even going
to ask. I can guess, but Iʼm
not going to ask. But I
know you must know this:
Amy likes to play God
when sheʼs not happy. Old
Testament God.”
“Meaning?”
“She
doles
out
punishment,” Tommy said.
“Hard.” He laughed into

the phone. “I mean, you
should see me,” he said. “I
do not look like some
alpha-male rapist. I look
like a twerp. I am a twerp.
My go-to karaoke song is
ʻSister
Christian,ʼ
for
crying out loud. I weep
during Godfather II. Every
time.” He coughed after a
swallow. Seemed like a
moment to loosen him up.
“Fredo?” I asked.

“Fredo, man, yeah.
Poor Fredo.”
“Stepped over.”
Most men have sports
as the lingua-franca of
dudes. This was the filmgeek
equivalent
to
discussing some great play
in a famous football game.
We both knew the line,
and the fact that we both
knew it eliminated a good
dayʼs worth of are we

copacetic small talk.
He took another drink.
“It was so fucking absurd.”
“Tell me.”
“Youʼre not taping this
or anything, right? No
oneʼs listening in? Because
I donʼt want that.”
“Just us. Iʼm on your
side.”
“So I meet Amy at a
party—this is, like, seven
years ago now—and sheʼs

so
damn
cool.
Just
hilarious
and
weird
and … cool. We just
clicked, you know, and I
donʼt click with a lot of
girls, at least not girls who
look like Amy. So Iʼm
thinking … well, first Iʼm
thinking Iʼm being punked.
Whereʼs the catch, you
know? But we start dating,
and we date a few months,
two, three months, and

then I find out the catch:
Sheʼs not the girl I thought
I was dating. She can quote
funny things, but she
doesnʼt actually like funny
things. Sheʼd rather not
laugh, anyway. In fact,
sheʼd rather that I not
laugh either, or be funny,
which is awkward since
itʼs my job, but to her, itʼs
all a waste of time. I mean,
I canʼt even figure out why

she started dating me in
the first place, because it
seems pretty clear that she
doesnʼt even like me. Does
that make sense?”
I nodded, swallowed a
gulp of Scotch. “Yeah. It
does.”
“So, I start making
excuses not to hang out so
much. I donʼt call it off,
because Iʼm an idiot, and
sheʼs gorgeous. Iʼm hoping

it might turn around. But
you know, Iʼm making
excuses fairly regularly:
Iʼm stuck at work, Iʼm on
deadline, I have a friend in
town, my monkey is sick,
whatever. And I start
seeing this other girl,
kinda sorta seeing her,
very casual, no big deal.
Or so I think. But Amy
finds out—how, I still
donʼt know, for all I know,

she was staking out my
apartment. But … shit …”
“Take a drink.”
We
both
took
a
swallow.
“Amy comes over to my
place one night—Iʼd been
seeing this other girl like a
month—and Amy comes
over, and sheʼs all back
like she used to be. Sheʼs
got some bootleg DVD of a
comic
I
like,
an

underground performance
in Durham, and sheʼs got a
sack of burgers, and we
watch the DVD, and sheʼs
got her leg flopped over
mine, and then sheʼs
nestling
into
me,
and … sorry. Sheʼs your
wife. My main point is:
The girl knew how to work
me. And we end up …”
“You had sex.”
“Consensual sex, yes.

And she leaves and
everything is fine. Kiss
goodbye at the door, the
whole shebang.”
“Then what?”
“The next thing I know,
two cops are at my door,
and theyʼve done a rape
kit on Amy, and she has
ʻwounds consistent with
forcible rape.ʼ And she has
ligature marks on her
wrists, and when they

search
my
apartment,
there on the headboard of
my bed are two ties—like,
neckties—tucked
down
near the mattress, and the
ties are, quote, ʻconsistent
with the ligature marks.ʼ ”
“Had you tied her up?”
“No, the sex wasnʼt
even that … that, you
know? I was totally caught
off guard. She must have
tied them there when I got

up to take a piss or
whatever. I mean, I was in
some serious shit. It was
looking very bad. And
then suddenly she dropped
the charges. Couple of
weeks later, I got a note,
anonymous, typed, says:
Maybe next time youʼll think
twice.”
“And you never heard
from her again?”
“Never heard from her

again.”
“And you didnʼt try to
press charges against her
or anything?”
“Uh, no. Fuck no. I was
just glad she went away.
Then last week, Iʼm eating
my Thai food, sitting in
my bed, watching the
news report. On Amy. On
you.
Perfect
wife,
anniversary, no body, real
shitstorm. I swear, I broke

out in a sweat. I thought:
Thatʼs Amy, sheʼs graduated
to murder. Holy shit. Iʼm
serious,
man,
I
bet
whatever sheʼs got cooked
up for you, itʼs drumfucking-tight. You should
be fucking scared.”

AMY
ELLIOTT
DUNNE
EIGHT
DAYS
GONE

I am wet from the
bumper boats; we got

more than five dollarsʼ
worth of time because the
two sun-stunned teenage
girls would rather flip
through gossip magazines
and smoke cigarettes than
try to herd us off the
water. So we spent a good
thirty minutes on our
lawn-mower-motorpropelled ships, ramming
each other and turning
wild twists, and then we

got bored and left of our
own accord.
Greta, Jeff, and I, an
odd crew in a strange
place. Greta and Jeff have
become good friends in
just a day, which is how
people do it here, where
thereʼs nothing else to do.
I think Greta is deciding
whether sheʼll make Jeff
another of her disastrous
mating choices. Jeff would

like it. He prefers her. She
is much prettier than I am,
right now, in this place.
Cheap pretty. She is
wearing a bikini top and
jean shorts, with a spare
shirt tucked into the back
pocket for when she wants
to enter a store (T-shirts,
wood carvings, decorative
rocks)
or
restaurant
(burger, barbecue, taffy).
She wants us to get Old

West photos taken, but
thatʼs not going to happen
for reasons aside from the
fact that I donʼt want
redneck-lake-person lice.
We end up settling for
a few rounds on a decrepit
miniature golf course. The
fake grass is torn off in
patches, the alligators and
windmills that once moved
mechanically are still. Jeff
does the honors instead,

twirling the windmill,
snapping open and shut
the gator jaws. Some holes
are simply unplayable—
the grass rolled up like
carpeting, the farmhouse
with
its
beckoning
mousehole collapsed in on
itself. So we roam between
courses in no particular
order. No one is even
keeping score.
This
would
have

annoyed Old Amy to no
end: the haphazardness of
it all, the pointlessness.
But Iʼm learning to drift,
and I do it quite well. I am
overachieving
at
aimlessness, I am a type-A,
alpha-girl lollygagger, the
leader of a gang of
heartbroken kids, running
wild across this lonely
strip of amusements, each
of us smarting from the

betrayals of a loved one. I
catch Jeff (cuckolded,
divorced,
complicated
custody
arrangement)
furrowing his brow as we
pass
a
Love
Tester:
Squeeze the metal grip and
watch the temperature rise
from “just a fling” to “soul
mate.” The odd equation—
a crushing clutch means
true love—reminds me of
poor
smacked-around

Greta, who often places
her thumb over the bruise
on her chest like itʼs a
button she can push.
“Youʼre up,” Greta says
to me. Sheʼs drying her
ball off on her shorts—
twice sheʼs gone into the
cesspool of dirty water.
I get in position, wiggle
once or twice, and putt my
bright red ball straight into
the birdhouse opening. It

disappears for a second,
then reappears out a chute
and
into
the
hole.
Disappear, reappear. I feel
a wave of anxiety—
everything reappears at
some point, even me. I am
anxious because I think my
plans have changed.
I have changed plans
only twice so far. The first
was the gun. I was going
to get a gun and then, on

the morning I disappeared,
I was going to shoot
myself.
Nowhere
dangerous: through a calf
or a wrist. I would leave
behind a bullet with my
flesh and blood on it. A
struggle occurred! Amy
was shot! But then I
realized this was a little
too macho even for me. It
would hurt for weeks, and
I donʼt love pain (my

sliced arm feels better
now, thank you very
much). But I still liked the
idea of a gun. It made for a
nice MacGuffin. Not Amy
was shot but Amy was
scared. So I dolled myself
up and went to the mall on
Valentineʼs Day, so Iʼd be
remembered. I couldnʼt get
one, but itʼs not a big deal
as far as changed plans go.
The other one is

considerably
more
extreme. I have decided
Iʼm not going to die.
I have the discipline to
kill myself, but canʼt
stomach the injustice. Itʼs
not fair that I have to die.
Not really die. I donʼt want
to. Iʼm not the one who
did anything wrong.
The
problem
now
though is money. Itʼs so
ludicrous, that of all things

itʼs money that should be
an issue for me. But I have
only a finite amount—
$9,132 at this point. I will
need more. This morning I
went to chat with Dorothy,
as always holding a
handkerchief so as not to
leave fingerprints (I told
her
it
was
my
grandmotherʼs—I try to
give
her
a
vague
impression of Southern

wealth gone to squander,
very Blanche DuBois). I
leaned against her desk as
she told me, in great
bureaucratic detail, about
a blood thinner she canʼt
afford—the woman is an
encyclopedia of denied
pharmaceuticals—and
then I said, just to test the
situation: “I know what
you mean. Iʼm not sure
where Iʼm going to get

rent for my cabin after
another week or two.”
She blinked at me, and
blinked back toward the
TV set, a game show
where people screamed
and cried a lot. She took a
grandmotherly interest in
me, sheʼd certainly let me
stay on, indefinitely: The
cabins were half empty, no
harm.
“You better get a job,

then,” Dorothy said, not
turning away from the TV.
A contestant made a bad
choice, the prize was lost,
a wuh-waaahhh sound
effect voiced her pain.
“A job like what? What
kind of job can I get
around here?”
“Cleaning, babysitting.”
Basically,
I
was
supposed
to
be
a
housewife for pay. Irony

enough for a million Hang
in There posters.
Itʼs true that even in
our lowly Missouri state, I
didnʼt
ever
have
to
actually budget. I couldnʼt
go out and buy a new car
just because I wanted to,
but I never had to think
about the day-to-day stuff,
coupon
clipping
and
buying
generic
and
knowing how much milk

costs off the top of my
head. My parents never
bothered teaching me this,
and so they left me
unprepared for the real
world. For instance, when
Greta complained that the
convenience store at the
marina
charged
five
dollars for a gallon of
milk, I winced because the
kid there always charged
me ten dollars. Iʼd thought

that seemed like a lot, but
it hadnʼt occurred to me
that the little pimply
teenager just threw out a
number to see if Iʼd pay.
So Iʼd budgeted, but
my budget—guaranteed,
according to the Internet,
to last me six to nine
months—is clearly off.
And so I am off.
When weʼre done with
golf—I win, of course I do,

I know because Iʼm
keeping score in my head
—we go to the hot-dog
stand next door for lunch,
and I slip around the
corner to dig into my
zippered money belt under
my shirt, and when I
glance back, Greta has
followed me, she catches
me right before I can stuff
the thing away.
“Ever heard of a purse,

Moneybags?” she cracks.
This will be an ongoing
problem—a person on the
run needs lots of cash, but
a person on the run by
definition has nowhere to
keep the cash. Thankfully,
Greta doesnʼt press the
issue—she knows we are
both victims here. We sit
in the sun on a metal
picnic bench and eat hot
dogs, white buns wrapped

around
cylinders
of
phosphate with relish so
green it looks toxic, and it
may be the greatest thing
Iʼve ever eaten because I
am Dead Amy and I donʼt
care.
“Guess what Jeff found
in his cabin for me?” Greta
says. “Another book by the
Martian Chronicle guy.”
“Ray Bradburrow,” Jeff
says. Bradbury, I think.

“Yeah, right. Something
Wicked This Way Comes,”
Greta says. “Itʼs good.” She
chirps the last bit as if that
were all to say about a
book: Itʼs good or itʼs bad.
I liked it or I didnʼt. No
discussions of the writing,
the themes, the nuances,
the structure. Just good or
bad. Like a hot dog.
“I read it when I first
moved in there,” Jeff says.

“It is good. Creepy.” He
catches me watching him
and makes a goblin face,
all crazy eyes and leering
tongue. He isnʼt my type—
the fur on the face is too
bristly, he does suspicious
things with fish—but he is
nice-looking.
Attractive.
His eyes are very warm,
not like Nickʼs frozen
blues. I wonder if “I” might
like sleeping with him—a

nice slow screw with his
body pressed against mine
and his breath in my ear,
the bristles on my cheeks,
not the lonely way Nick
fucks, where our bodies
barely connect: right angle
from behind, L-shape from
the front, and then heʼs
out
of
bed
almost
immediately, hitting the
shower,
leaving
me
pulsing in his wet spot.

“Cat got your tongue?”
Jeff says. He never calls
me by name, as if to
acknowledge that we both
know Iʼve lied. He says this
lady or pretty woman or
you. I wonder what he
would call me in bed.
Baby, maybe.
“Just thinking.”
“Uh-oh,” he says, and
smiles again.
“You were thinking

about a boy, I can tell,”
Greta says.
“Maybe.”
“I thought we were
steering clear of the
assholes for a while,” she
says.
“Tend
to
our
chickens.” Last night after
Ellen Abbott, I was too
excited to go home, so we
shared a six-pack and
imagined our recluse life
as the token straight girls

on
Gretaʼs
motherʼs
lesbian compound, raising
chickens
and
hanging
laundry to dry in the sun.
The objects of gentle,
platonic courtship from
older women with gnarled
knuckles and indulgent
laughs.
Denim
and
corduroy and clogs and
never
worrying
about
makeup or hair or nails,
breast size or hip size, or

having to pretend to be the
understanding wifey, the
supportive girlfriend who
loves everything her man
does.
“Not all guys are
assholes,” Jeff says. Greta
makes a noncommittal
noise.
We return to our cabins
liquid-limbed. I feel like a
water balloon left in the
sun. All I want to do is sit

under
my
sputtering
window air conditioner
and blast my skin with the
cool while watching TV.
Iʼve found a rerun channel
that shows nothing but old
ʼ70s and ʼ80s shows,
Quincy and The Love Boat
and Eight Is Enough, but
first comes Ellen Abbott,
my new favorite show!
Nothing new, nothing
new. Ellen doesnʼt mind

speculating, believe me,
sheʼs hosted an array of
strangers from my past
who swear they are my
friends, and they all have
lovely things to say about
me, even the ones who
never much liked me. Postlife fondness.
Knock on the door, and
I know it will be Greta and
Jeff. I switch off the TV,
and there they are on my

doorstep, aimless.
“Whatcha doing?” Jeff
asks.
“Reading,” I lie.
He sets down a six-pack
of beer on my counter,
Greta padding in behind.
“Oh, I thought we heard
the TV.”
Three is literally a
crowd in these small
cabins. They are blocking
the door for a second,

sending
a
pulse
of
nervousness through me—
why are they blocking the
door?—and then they keep
moving and they are
blocking my bedside table.
Inside my bedside table is
my money belt packed
with
eight
thousand
dollars in cash. Hundreds,
fifties, and twenty-dollar
bills. The money belt is
hideous, flesh-colored and

bunchy. I canʼt possibly
wear all my money at once
—I leave some scattered
around the cabin—but I
try to wear most, and
when I do, I am as
conscious of it as a girl at
the beach with a maxipad.
A perverse part of me
enjoys spending money,
because every time I pull
off a wad of twenties,
thatʼs less money to hide,

to worry about being
stolen or lost.
Jeff clicks on the TV,
and Ellen Abbott—and
Amy—buzz into focus. He
nods, smiles to himself.
“Want
to
watch … Amy?” Greta
asks.
I canʼt tell if she used a
comma: Want to watch,
Amy? or Want to watch
Amy?

“Nah. Jeff, why donʼt
you grab your guitar and
we can sit on the porch?”
Jeff
and
Greta
exchange a look.
“Awww … but thatʼs
what you were watching,
right?” Greta says. She
points at the screen, and
itʼs me and Nick at a
benefit, me in a gown, my
hair pulled back in a
chignon, and I look more

like I look now, with my
short hair.
“Itʼs boring,” I say.
“Oh, I donʼt think itʼs
boring at all,” Greta says,
and flops down on my bed.
I think what a fool I
am, to have let these two
people inside. To have
assumed I could control
them, when they are feral
creatures, people used to
finding
the
angle,

exploiting the weakness,
always needing, whereas I
am new to this. Needing.
Those people who keep
backyard
pumas
and
living-room chimps—this
must be how they feel
when their adorable pet
rips them open.
“You
know
what,
would you guys mind … I
feel kinda crummy. Too
much sun, I think.”

They look surprised
and a little offended, and I
wonder if Iʼve got it wrong
—that they are harmless
and Iʼm just paranoid. Iʼd
like to believe that.
“Sure, sure, of course,”
Jeff says. They shuffle out
of my cabin, Jeff grabbing
his beer on the way. A
minute later, I hear Ellen
Abbott
snarling
from
Gretaʼs
cabin.
The

accusatory questions. Why
did … Why didnʼt … How
can you explain …
Why did I ever let
myself get friendly with
anyone here? Why didnʼt I
keep to myself? How can I
explain my actions if Iʼm
found out?
I canʼt be discovered. If
I were ever found, Iʼd be
the most hated woman on
the planet. Iʼd go from

being the beautiful, kind,
doomed, pregnant victim
of a selfish, cheating
bastard to being the bitter
bitch who exploited the
good
hearts
of
all
Americaʼs citizens. Ellen
Abbott would devote show
after show to me, angry
callers venting their hate:
“This is just another
example of a spoiled rich
girl doing what she wants,

when she wants, and not
thinking of anyone elseʼs
feelings, Ellen. I think she
should disappear for life—
in prison!” Like that, it
would go like that. Iʼve
read conflicting Internet
information
on
the
penalties for faking a
death, or framing a spouse
for said death, but I know
the public opinion would
be brutal. No matter what

I do after that—feed
orphans, cuddle lepers—
when I died, Iʼd be known
as That Woman Who
Faked Her Death and
Framed Her Husband, You
Remember.
I canʼt allow it.
Hours later, I am still
awake, thinking in the
dark, when my door
rattles, a gentle bang,
Jeffʼs bang. I debate, then

open it, ready to apologize
for my rudeness before.
Heʼs tugging on his beard,
staring at my doormat,
then looks up with amber
eyes.
“Dorothy said you were
looking for work,” he said.
“Yeah. I guess. I am.”
“I
got
something
tonight, pay you fifty
bucks.”
Amy Elliott Dunne

wouldnʼt leave her cabin
for fifty bucks, but Lydia
and/or Nancy needs work.
I have to say yes.
“Coupla hours, fifty
dollars.”
He
shrugs.
“Doesnʼt
make
any
difference to me, just
thought Iʼd offer.”
“What is it?”
“Fishing.”
I was positive Jeff
would drive a pickup, but

he guides me to a shiny
Ford
hatchback,
a
heartbreaking car, the car
of the new college grad
with big plans and a
modest budget, not the car
a grown man should be
driving. I am wearing my
swimsuit
under
my
sundress, as instructed.
(“Not the bikini, the full
one, the one you can really
swim in,” Jeff intoned; Iʼd

never
noticed
him
anywhere near the pool,
but he knew my swimwear
cold, which was flattering
and alarming at the same
time.)
He leaves the windows
down as we drive through
the forested hills, the
gravel dust coating my
stubby hair. It feels like
something from a countrymusic video: the girl in the

sundress leaning out to
catch the breeze of a redstate summer night. I can
see stars. Jeff hums off and
on.
He parks down the
road from a restaurant that
hangs out on stilts over the
lake, a barbecue place
known
for
its
giant
souvenir cups of boozy
drinks with bad names:
Gator Juice and Bassmouth

Blitz. I know this from the
discarded cups that float
along all the shores of the
lake, cracked and neoncolored
with
the
restaurantʼs logo: Catfish
Carlʼs. Catfish Carlʼs has a
deck that overhangs the
water—diners can load up
on handfuls of kitty kibble
from the crank machines
and drop them into the
gaping
mouths
of

hundreds of giant catfish
that wait below.
“What exactly are we
going to do, Jeff?”
“You net ʼem, I kill
ʼem.” He gets out of the
car, and I follow him
around to the hatchback,
which is filled with
coolers. “We put ʼem in
here, on ice, resell them.”
“Resell them. Who buys
stolen fish?”

Jeff smiles that lazy-cat
smile. “I got a clientele of
sorts.”
And then I realize: He
isnʼt a Grizzly Adams,
guitar-playing,
peaceloving granola guy at all.
He is a redneck thief who
wants to believe that heʼs
more complicated than
that.
He pulls out a net, a
box of Nine Lives, and a

stained plastic bucket.
I have absolutely no
intention of being part of
this
illicit
piscine
economy, but “I” am fairly
interested. How many
women can say they were
part of a fish-smuggling
ring? “I” am game. I have
become game again since I
died. All the things I
disliked or feared, all the
limits I had, theyʼve slid

off me. “I” can do pretty
much anything. A ghost
has that freedom.
We walk down the hill,
under the deck of Catfish
Carlʼs, and onto the docks,
which float slurpily on the
wakes
of
a
passing
motorboat, Jimmy Buffett
blaring.
Jeff hands me a net.
“We need this to be quick
—you just jump in the

water, scoop the net in,
nab the fish, then tilt the
net up to me. Itʼll be
heavy,
though,
and
squirmy, so be prepared.
And donʼt scream or
nothing.”
“I wonʼt scream. But I
donʼt want to go in the
water. I can do it from the
deck.”
“You should take off
your dress, at least, youʼll

ruin it.”
“Iʼm okay.”
He looks annoyed for a
moment—heʼs the boss,
Iʼm the employee, and so
far Iʼm not listening to him
—but then he turns around
modestly and tugs off his
shirt and hands me the box
of cat food without fully
facing me, as if heʼs shy. I
hold the box with its
narrow mouth over the

water, and immediately, a
hundred shiny arched
backs roll toward me, a
mob of serpents, the tails
cutting across the surface
furiously, and then the
mouths are below me, the
fish roiling over each other
to swallow the pellets and
then, like trained pets,
aiming their faces up
toward me for more.
I scoop the net into the

middle of the pack and sit
down hard on the dock to
get leverage to pull the
harvest up. When I yank,
the net is full of half a
dozen
whiskery,
slick
catfish,
all
frantically
trying to get back in the
water, their gaping lips
opening
and
shutting
between the squares of
nylon, their collective
tugging making the net

wobble up and down.
“Lift it up, lift it up,
girl!”
I push a knee below the
netʼs handle and let it
dangle there, Jeff reaching
in, grabbing a fish with
two hands, each encased
in terry-cloth manicure
gloves for a better grip. He
moves his hands down
around the tail, then
swings the fish like a

cudgel, smashing its head
on the side of the dock.
Blood explodes. A brief
sharp pelt of it streaks
across my legs, a hard
chunk of meat hits my
hair. Jeff throws the fish in
the bucket and grabs
another with assembly-line
smoothness.
We work in grunts and
wheezes for half an hour,
four nets full, until my

arms turn rubbery and the
ice chests are full. Jeff
takes the empty pail and
fills it with water from the
lake, pours it across the
messy entrails and into the
fish pens. The catfish
gobble up the guts of their
fallen brethren. The dock
is left clean. He pours one
last pail of water across
our bloody feet.
“Why do you have to

smash them?” I ask.
“Canʼt stand to watch
something suffer,” he says.
“Quick dunk?”
“Iʼm okay,” I say.
“Not in my car, youʼre
not—come on, quick dunk,
you have more crap on
you than you realize.”
We run off the dock
toward the rocky beach
nearby. While I wade
ankle-deep in the water,

Jeff runs with giant
splashy
footsteps
and
throws himself forward,
arms wild. As soon as heʼs
far enough out, I unhook
my money belt and fold
my sundress around it,
leave it at the waterʼs edge
with my glasses on top. I
lower myself until I feel
the warm water hit my
thighs, my belly, my neck,
and then I hold my breath

and go under.
I swim far and fast,
stay underwater longer
than I should to remind
myself what it would feel
like to drown—I know I
could do it if I needed to—
and when I come up with
a single disciplined gasp, I
see Jeff lapping rapidly
toward shore, and I have
to swim fast as a porpoise
back to my money belt and

scramble onto the rocks
just ahead of him.

NICK DUNNE
EIGHT
DAYS
GONE

As soon as I hung up
with Tommy, I phoned
Hilary Handy. If my
“murder” of Amy was a lie,

and
Tommy
OʼHaraʼs
“rape” of Amy was a lie,
why not Hilary Handyʼs
“stalking” of Amy? A
sociopath must cut her
teeth somewhere, like the
austere marble halls of
Wickshire Academy.
When she picked up, I
blurted: “This is Nick
Dunne,
Amy
Elliottʼs
husband. I really need to
talk to you.”

“Why?”
“I really, really need
more information. About
your—”
“Donʼt say friendship.” I
heard an angry grin in her
voice.
“No. I wouldnʼt. I just
want to hear your side. I
am not calling because I
think youʼve got anything
—anything—to do with my
wife,
her
situation,

currently. But I would
really like to hear what
happened.
The
truth.
Because I think you may
be able to shed light on
a … pattern of behavior of
Amyʼs.”
“What kind of pattern?”
“When very bad things
happen to people who
upset her.”
She breathed heavily
into the phone. “Two days

ago, I wouldnʼt have
talked to you,” she started.
“But then I was having a
drink with some friends,
and the TV was on, and
you came on, and it was
about
Amy
being
pregnant. Everyone I was
with, they were so angry at
you. They hated you. And I
thought, I know how that
feels. Because sheʼs not
dead, right? I mean, sheʼs

still just missing? No
body?”
“Thatʼs right.”
“So let me tell you.
About Amy. And high
school.
And
what
happened. Hold on.” On
her end, I could hear
cartoons playing—rubbery
voices and calliope music
—then suddenly not. Then
whining voices. Go watch
downstairs.
Downstairs,

please.
“So, freshman year. Iʼm
the kid from Memphis.
Everyone else is East Coast,
I swear. It felt weird,
different, you know? All
the girls at Wickshire, it
was like theyʼd been raised
communally—the
lingo,
the clothes, the hair. And
it wasnʼt like I was a
pariah,
I
was
just … insecure, for sure.

Amy was already The Girl.
Like, first day, I remember,
everyone
knew
her,
everyone
was
talking
about
her.
She
was
Amazing Amy—weʼd all
read those books growing
up—plus, she was just
gorgeous. I mean, she was
—”
“Yeah, I know.”
“Right. And pretty soon
she was showing an

interest in me, like, taking
me under her wing or
whatever. She had this
joke that she was Amazing
Amy, so I was her sidekick
Suzy, and she started
calling me Suzy, and
pretty soon everyone else
did too. Which was fine by
me. I mean, I was a little
toadie: Get Amy a drink if
she was thirsty, throw in a
load of laundry if she

needed clean underwear.
Hold on.”
Again I could hear the
shuffle of her hair against
the receiver. Marybeth had
brought every Elliott photo
album with her in case we
needed more pictures.
Sheʼd shown me a photo of
Amy and Hilary, cheek-tocheek grins. So I could
picture Hilary now, the
same butter-blond hair as

my wife, framing a plainer
face, with muddy hazel
eyes.
“Jason, I am on the
phone—just give them a few
Popsicles, itʼs not that dang
hard.
“Sorry. Our kids are out
of school, and my husband
never ever takes care of
them, so he seems a little
confused about what to do
for the ten minutes Iʼm on

the phone with you. Sorry.
So … so, right, I was little
Suzy, and we had this
game going, and for a few
months—August,
September,
October—it
was great. Like intense
friendship,
we
were
together all the time. And
then a few weird things
happened at once that I
knew kind of bothered
her.”

“What?”
“A guy from our
brother school, he meets
us both at the fall dance,
and the next day he calls
me instead of Amy. Which
Iʼm sure he did because
Amy was too intimidating,
but whatever … and then
a few days later, our
midterm grades come, and
mine are slightly better,
like, four-point-one versus

four-point-oh. And not
long after, one of our
friends, she invites me to
spend Thanksgiving with
her family. Me, not Amy.
Again, Iʼm sure this was
because Amy intimidated
people. She wasnʼt easy to
be around, you felt all the
time like you had to
impress. But I can feel
things change just a little. I
can tell sheʼs really

irritated, even though she
doesnʼt admit it.
“Instead, she starts
getting me to do things. I
donʼt realize it at the time,
but she starts setting me
up. She asks if she can
color my hair the same
blond as hers, because
mineʼs mousy, and itʼll
look so nice a brighter
shade. And she starts
complaining about her

parents. I mean sheʼs
always complained about
her parents, but now she
really gets going on them
—how they only love her
as an idea and not really
for who she is—so she says
she wants to mess with her
parents. She has me start
prank-calling her house,
telling her parents Iʼm the
new Amazing Amy. Weʼd
take the train into New

York some weekends, and
sheʼd tell me to stand
outside their house—one
time she had me run up to
her mom and tell her I was
going to get rid of Amy
and be her new Amy or
some crap like that.”
“And you did it?”
“It was just dumb stuff
girls do. Back before cell
phones and cyber-bullying.
A way to kill time. We did

prank stuff like that all the
time, just dumb stuff. Try
to one-up each other on
how daring and freaky we
could be.”
“Then what?”
“Then
she
starts
distancing herself. She gets
cold. And I think—I think
that she doesnʼt like me
anymore. Girls at school
start looking at me funny.
Iʼm shut out of the cool

circle. Fine. But then one
day Iʼm called in to see the
headmistress. Amy has had
a
horrible
accident—
twisted ankle, fractured
arm, cracked ribs. Amy has
fallen down this long set of
stairs, and she says it was
me who pushed her. Hold
on.
“Go back downstairs
now. Go. Down. Stairs.
Goooo downstairs.

“Sorry, Iʼm back. Never
have kids.”
“So Amy said you
pushed her?” I asked.
“Yeah, because I was
craaaazy. I was obsessed
with her, and I wanted to
be Suzy, and then being
Suzy wasnʼt enough—I
had to be Amy. And she
had all this evidence that
sheʼd had me create over
the past few months. Her

parents, obviously, had
seen me lurking around the
house.
I
theoretically
accosted her mom. My
hair dyed blond and the
clothes Iʼd bought that
matched Amyʼs—clothes I
bought while shopping
with her, but I couldnʼt
prove that. All her friends
came in, explained how
Amy for the past month
had been so frightened of

me. All this shit. I looked
totally insane. Completely
insane. Her parents got a
restraining order on me.
And I kept swearing it
wasnʼt me, but by then I
was so miserable that I
wanted to leave school
anyway. So we didnʼt fight
the expulsion. I wanted to
get away from her by that
time. I mean, the girl
cracked her own ribs. I was

scared—this little fifteenyear-old, sheʼd pulled this
off.
Fooled
friends,
parents, teachers.”
“And this was all
because of a boy and some
grades and a Thanksgiving
invitation?”
“About a month after I
moved back to Memphis, I
got a letter. It wasnʼt
signed, it was typed, but it
was obviously Amy. It was

a list of all the ways Iʼd let
her down. Crazy stuff:
Forgot to wait for me after
English, twice. Forgot I am
allergic to strawberries,
twice.”
“Jesus.”
“But I feel like the real
reason wasnʼt even on
there.”
“What was the real
reason?”
“I feel like Amy wanted

people to believe she
really was perfect. And as
we got to be friends, I got
to know her. And she
wasnʼt perfect. You know?
She was brilliant and
charming and all that, but
she was also controlling
and OCD and a drama
queen and a bit of a liar.
Which was fine by me. It
just wasnʼt fine by her. She
got rid of me because I

knew she wasnʼt perfect. It
made me wonder about
you.”
“About me? Why?”
“Friends see most of
each otherʼs flaws. Spouses
see every awful last bit. If
she punished a friend of a
few months by throwing
herself down a flight of
stairs, what would she do
to a man who was dumb
enough to marry her?”

I hung up as one of
Hilaryʼs kids picked up the
second
extension
and
began singing a nursery
rhyme.
I
immediately
phoned
Tanner
and
relayed my conversations
with Hilary and Tommy.
“So we have a couple
of stories, great,” Tanner
said, “thisʼll really be
great!” in a way that told
me it wasnʼt that great.

“Have you heard from
Andie?”
I hadnʼt.
“I have one of my
people waiting for her at
her apartment building,”
he said. “Discreet.”
“I didnʼt know you had
people.”
“What we really need is
to find Amy,” he said,
ignoring me. “Girl like
that, I canʼt imagine sheʼd

be able to stay hidden for
too long. You have any
thoughts?”
I kept picturing her on
a posh hotel balcony near
the ocean, wrapped in a
white robe thick as a rug,
sipping a very good
Montrachet, while she
tracked my ruin on the
Internet, on cable, in the
tabloids.
While
she
enjoyed
the
endless

coverage and exultation of
Amy
Elliott
Dunne.
Attending her own funeral.
I wondered if she was selfaware enough to realize:
Sheʼd stolen a page from
Mark Twain.
“I picture her near the
ocean,” I said. Then I
stopped, feeling like a
boardwalk psychic. “No. I
have no ideas. She could
literally be anywhere. I

donʼt think weʼll see her
unless she decides to come
back.”
“That seems unlikely,”
Tanner breathed, annoyed.
“So letʼs try to find Andie
and see where her head is.
Weʼre running out of
wiggle room here.”
Then it was dinnertime,
and then the sun set, and I
was alone again in my
haunted house. I was

thinking about all of
Amyʼs lies and whether
the pregnancy was one of
them. Iʼd done the math.
Amy and I had sex
sporadically enough it was
possible. But then she
would know Iʼd do the
math.
Truth or lie? If it was a
lie, it was designed to gut
me.
Iʼd always assumed

that Amy and I would
have children. It was one
of the reasons I knew I
would
marry
Amy,
because I pictured us
having kids together. I
remember the first time I
imagined it, not two
months after we began
dating: I was walking from
my apartment in Kips Bay
to a favorite pocket park
along the East River, a

path that took me past the
giant LEGO block of the
United
Nations
headquarters, the flags of
myriad countries fluttering
in the wind. A kid would
like this, I thought. All the
different colors, the busy
memory game of matching
each flag to its country.
Thereʼs Finland, and thereʼs
New Zealand. The one-eyed
smile of Mauritania. And

then I realized it wasnʼt a
kid, but our kid, mine and
Amyʼs, who would like
this. Our kid, sprawled on
the floor with an old
encyclopedia, just like Iʼd
done, but our kid wouldnʼt
be alone, Iʼd be sprawled
next to him. Aiding him in
his budding vexillology,
which sounds less like a
study of flags than a study
in
annoyance,
which

would have suited my
fatherʼs attitude toward
me. But not mine toward
my sonʼs. I pictured Amy
joining us on the floor, flat
on her stomach, her feet
kicked up in the air,
pointing out Palau, the
yellow dot just left of
center on the crisp blue
background, which I was
sure would be her favorite.
From then on, the boy

was real (and sometimes a
girl, but mostly a boy). He
was inevitable. I suffered
from regular, insistent
paternal aches. Months
after the wedding, I had a
strange moment in front of
the medicine cabinet, floss
between my teeth, when I
thought: She wants kids,
right? I should ask. Of
course I should ask. When I
posed
the
question—

roundabout,
vague—she
said, Of course, of course,
someday,
but
every
morning she still perched
in front of the sink and
swallowed her pill. For
three years she did this
every morning, while I
fluttered near the topic but
failed to actually say the
words: I want us to have a
baby.
After the layoffs, it

seemed like it might
happen. Suddenly, there
was
an
uncontestable
space in our lives, and one
day over breakfast, Amy
looked up from her toast
and said, Iʼm off the pill.
Just like that. She was off
the pill three months, and
nothing happened, and not
long after the move to
Missouri, she made an
appointment for us to start

the medical intervention.
Once Amy started a
project, she didnʼt like to
dilly-dally: “Weʼll tell them
weʼve been trying a year,”
she said. Foolishly I agreed
—we were barely ever
touching each other by
then, but we still thought a
kid made sense. Sure.
“Youʼll have to do your
part too, you know,” she
said on the drive to St.

Louis. “Youʼll have to give
semen.”
“I know. Why do you
say it like that?”
“I just figured youʼd be
too proud. Self-conscious
and proud.”
I was a rather nasty
cocktail of both those
traits, but at the fertility
center, I dutifully entered
the strange small room
dedicated to self-abuse: a

place where hundreds of
men had entered for no
other purpose than to
crank the shank, clean the
rifle, jerk the gherkin,
make the bald man cry,
pound the flounder, sail
the
mayonnaise
seas,
wiggle
the
walrus,
whitewash with Tom and
Huck.
(I
sometimes
use
humor as self-defense.)

The room contained a
vinyl-covered armchair, a
TV, and a table that held a
grab bag of porn and a box
of tissues. The porn was
early ʼ90s, judging from
the womenʼs hair (yes: top
and bottom), and the
action
was
midcore.
(Another good essay: Who
selects the porn for fertility
centers? Who judges what
will get men off yet not be

too degrading to all the
women outside the cumroom, the nurses and
doctors
and
hopeful,
hormone-addled wives?)
I visited the room on
three separate occasions—
they like to have a lot of
backup—while Amy did
nothing. She was supposed
to begin taking pills, but
she didnʼt, and then she
didnʼt some more. She was

the
one
whoʼd
be
pregnant, the one whoʼd
turn over her body to the
baby, so I postponed
nudging her for a few
months, keeping an eye on
the pill bottle to see if the
level went down. Finally,
after a few beers one
winter night, I crunched
up the steps of our home,
shed my snow-crusted
clothes, and curled up next

to her in bed, my face near
her shoulder, breathing
her in, warming the tip of
my nose on her skin. I
whispered the words—
Letʼs do this, Amy, letʼs have
a baby—and she said no. I
was
expecting
nervousness,
caution,
worry—Nick, will I be a
good mom?—but I got a
clipped, cold no. A no
without
loopholes.

Nothing dramatic, no big
deal, just not something
she was interested in
anymore.
“Because
I
realized Iʼd be stuck doing
all the hard stuff,” she
reasoned. “All the diapers
and doctorsʼ appointments
and discipline, and youʼd
just breeze in and be Fun
Daddy. Iʼd do all the work
to make them good people,
and youʼd undo it anyway,

and theyʼd love you and
hate me.”
I told Amy it wasnʼt
true, but she didnʼt believe
me. I told her I didnʼt just
want a child, I needed a
child. I had to know I
could love a person
unconditionally, that I
could
make
a
little
creature feel constantly
welcome and wanted no
matter what. That I could

be a different kind of
father than my dad was.
That I could raise a boy
who wasnʼt like me.
I begged her. Amy
remained unmoved.
A year later, I got a
notice in the mail: The
clinic would dispose of my
semen unless they heard
from us. I left the letter on
the dining room table, an
open rebuke. Three days

later, I saw it in the trash.
That
was
our
final
communication on the
subject.
By then Iʼd already
been secretly dating Andie
for months, so I had no
right to be upset. But that
didnʼt stop my aching, and
it didnʼt stop me from
daydreaming about our
boy, mine and Amyʼs. Iʼd
gotten attached to him.

The fact was, Amy and I
would make a great child.
The marionettes were
watching me with alarmed
black eyes. I peered out
my window, saw that the
news trucks had packed it
in, so I went out into the
warm night. Time to walk.
Maybe a lone tabloid
writer was trailing me; if
so, I didnʼt care. I headed

through our complex, then
forty-five
minutes
out
along River Road, then
onto the highway that shot
right through the middle
of Carthage. Thirty loud,
fumy minutes—past car
dealerships with trucks
displayed appealingly like
desserts, past fast-food
chains and liquor stores
and mini-marts and gas
stations—until I reached

the turnoff for downtown.
I had encountered not a
single other person on foot
the entire time, only
faceless blurs whizzing
past me in cars.
It
was
close
to
midnight. I passed The
Bar, tempted to go in but
put off by the crowds. A
reporter or two had to be
camped out in there. Itʼs
what I would do. But I

wanted to be in a bar. I
wanted to be surrounded
by people, having fun,
blowing off steam. I
walked another fifteen
minutes to the other end of
downtown, to a cheesier,
rowdier,
younger
bar
where the bathrooms were
always laced with vomit
on Saturday nights. It was
a bar that Andieʼs crowd
would go to, and perhaps,

who knew, drag along
Andie. It would be a nice
bit of luck to see her there.
At least gauge her mood
from across the room. And
if she wasnʼt there then Iʼd
have a fucking drink.
I went as deep into the
bar as I could—no Andie,
no Andie. My face was
partially covered by a
baseball cap. Even so, I felt
a few pings as I moved

past crowds of drinkers:
heads abruptly turning
toward me, the wide eyes
of identification. That guy!
Right?
Mid-July. I wondered if
Iʼd become so nefarious
come October, Iʼd be some
frat
boyʼs
tasteless
Halloween costume: mop
of blond hair, an Amazing
Amy book tucked under an
armpit. Go said sheʼd

received half a dozen
phone calls asking if The
Bar had an official T-shirt
for sale. (We didnʼt, thank
God.)
I sat down and ordered
a
Scotch
from
the
bartender, a guy about my
age who stared at me a
beat too long, deciding
whether he would serve
me. He finally, grudgingly,
set down a small tumbler

in front of me, his nostrils
flared. When I got out my
wallet, he aimed an
alarmed palm up at me. “I
do not want your money,
man. Not at all.”
I left cash anyway.
Asshole.
When I tried to flag
him for another drink, he
glanced my way, shook his
head, and leaned in
toward the woman he was

chatting up. A few seconds
later, she discreetly looked
toward me, pretending she
was stretching. Her mouth
turned down as she
nodded. Thatʼs him. Nick
Dunne.
The
bartender
never came back.
You canʼt yell, you
canʼt strong-arm: Hey,
jackass, will you get me a
goddamn drink or what?
You canʼt be the asshole

they believe you are. You
just have to sit and take it.
But I wasnʼt leaving. I sat
with my empty glass in
front of me and pretended
I was thinking very hard. I
checked my disposable
cell, just in case Andie had
called. No. Then I pulled
out my real phone and
played a round of solitaire,
pretending
to
be
engrossed. My wife had

done this to me, turned me
into a man who couldnʼt
get a drink in his own
hometown. God, I hated
her.
“Was it Scotch?”
A girl about Andieʼs
age was standing in front
of me. Asian, black
shoulder-length
hair,
cubicle-cute.
“Excuse me?”
“What
you
were

drinking? Scotch?”
“Yeah. Having trouble
getting—”
She was gone, to the
end of the bar, and she
was nosing into the
bartenderʼs line of vision
with a big help me smile, a
girl used to making her
presence known, and then
she was back with a Scotch
in an actual big-boy
tumbler.

“Take it,” she nudged,
and I did. “Cheers.” She
held up her own clear,
fizzing drink. We clinked
glasses. “Can I sit?”
“Iʼm not staying long,
actually—”
I
looked
around, making sure no
one
was
aiming
a
cameraphone at us.
“So, okay,” she said
with a shruggy smile. “I
could pretend I donʼt know

youʼre Nick Dunne, but
Iʼm not going to insult
you. Iʼm rooting for you,
by the way. Youʼve been
getting a bad rap.”
“Thanks. Itʼs, uh, itʼs a
weird time.”
“Iʼm serious. You know
how, in court, they talk
about the CSI effect? Like,
everyone on the jury has
watched so much CSI that
they believe science can

prove anything?”
“Yeah.”
“Well, I think thereʼs an
Evil
Husband
effect.
Everyone has seen too
many true-crime shows
where the husband is
always, always the killer,
so people automatically
assume the husbandʼs the
bad guy.”
“Thatʼs exactly it,” I
said. “Thank you. That is

exactly it. And Ellen
Abbott—”
“Fuck Ellen Abbott,”
my new friend said. “Sheʼs
a one-woman walking,
talking,
man-hating
perversion of the justice
system.” She raised her
glass again.
“Whatʼs your name?” I
asked.
“Another Scotch?”
“Thatʼs a gorgeous

name.”
Her name, as it turned
out, was Rebecca. She had
a ready credit card and a
hollow
leg.
(Another?
Another? Another?) She
was from Muscatine, Iowa
(another Mississippi River
town), and had moved to
New York after undergrad
to be a writer (also like
me). Sheʼd been an
editorial assistant at three

different
magazines—a
bridal
magazine,
a
working-mom magazine, a
teen-girl magazine—all of
which had shuttered in the
past few years, so she was
now working for a crime
blog called Whodunnit,
and she was (giggle) in
town to try to get an
interview with me. Hell, I
had to love her hungry-kid
chutzpah: Just fly me to

Carthage—the
major
networks havenʼt gotten him,
but Iʼm sure I can!
“Iʼve
been
waiting
outside your house with
the rest of the world, and
then at the police station,
and then I decided I
needed a drink. And here
you walk in. Itʼs just too
perfect. Too weird, right?”
she said. She had little
gold hoop earrings that

she kept playing with, her
hair tucked behind her
ears.
“I should go,” I said.
My words were sticky
around the edges, the
beginnings of a slur.
“But you never told me
why youʼre here,” Rebecca
said. “I have to say, it
takes a lot of courage, I
think, for you to head out
without a friend or some

sort of backup. I bet you
get a lot of shitty looks.”
I shrugged: No big deal.
“People
judging
everything you do without
even knowing you. Like
you with the cell-phone
photo at the park. I mean,
you were probably like
me: You were raised to be
polite. But no one wants
the real story. They just
want to … gotcha. You

know?”
“Iʼm just tired of people
judging me because I fit
into a certain mold.”
She
raised
her
eyebrows; her earrings
jittered.
I thought of Amy
sitting in her mystery
control center, wherever
the fuck she was, judging
me from every angle,
finding me wanting even

from afar. Was there
anything she could see
that would make her call
off this madness?
I went on, “I mean,
people think we were in a
rocky
marriage,
but
actually, right before she
disappeared,
she
put
together a treasure hunt
for me.”
Amy would want one
of two things: for me to

learn my lesson and fry
like the bad boy I was; or
for me to learn my lesson
and love her the way she
deserved and be a good,
obedient,
chastised,
dickless little boy.
“This
wonderful
treasure hunt.” I smiled.
Rebecca shook her head
with a little-V frown. “My
wife, she always did a
treasure hunt for our

anniversary. One clue
leads to a special place
where I find the next clue,
and so on. Amy …” I tried
to get my eyes to fill,
settled for wiping them.
The clock above the door
read 12:37 A.M. “Before
she went missing, she hid
all the clues. For this
year.”
“Before
she
disappeared
on
your

anniversary.”
“And itʼs been all thatʼs
kept me together. It made
me feel closer to her.”
Rebecca pulled out a
Flip camera. “Let me
interview
you.
On
camera.”
“Bad idea.”
“Iʼll give it context,”
she said. “Thatʼs exactly
what you need, Nick, I
swear. Context. You need

it bad. Come on, just a few
words.”
I shook my head. “Too
dangerous.”
“Say what you just
said. Iʼm serious, Nick. Iʼm
the opposite of Ellen
Abbott. The anti–Ellen
Abbott. You need me in
your life.” She held up the
camera, its tiny red light
eyeing me.
“Seriously, turn it off.”

“Help a girl out. I get
the Nick Dunne interview?
My career is made. Youʼve
done your good deed for
the year. Pleeease? No
harm, Nick, one minute.
Just one minute. I swear I
will only make you look
good.”
She motioned to a
nearby booth where weʼd
be tucked out of view of
any gawkers. I nodded and

we resettled, that little red
light aimed at me the
whole time.
“What do you want to
know?” I asked.
“Tell me about the
treasure hunt. It sounds
romantic. Like, quirky,
awesome, romantic.”
Take control of the story,
Nick. For both the capitalP public and the capital-C
wife. Right now, I thought,

I am a man who loves his
wife and will find her. I am
a man who loves his wife,
and I am the good guy. I am
the one to root for. I am a
man who isnʼt perfect, but
my wife is, and I will be
very, very obedient from
now on.
I could do this more
easily than feign sadness.
Like I said, I can operate in
sunlight. Still, I felt my

throat tighten as I got
ready to say the words.
“My wife, she just
happens to be the coolest
girl Iʼve ever met. How
many guys can say that? I
married the coolest girl I
ever met.”
Youfuckingbitchyoufucking
Come home so I can kill
you.

AMY
ELLIOTT
DUNNE
NINE
DAYS
GONE

I wake up feeling
immediately nervous. Off.

I cannot be found here,
thatʼs what I wake up
thinking, a burst of words,
like a flash in my brain.
The investigation is not
going fast enough, and my
money situation is just the
opposite, and Jeffʼs and
Gretaʼs greedy antennae
are up. And I smell like
fish.
There was something
about Jeff and that race to

the shoreline, toward my
bundled dress and my
money belt. Something
about the way Greta keeps
alighting on Ellen Abbott. It
makes me nervous. Or am
I being paranoid? I sound
like Diary Amy: Is my
husband going to kill me or
am I imagining!?!? For the
first time I actually feel
sorry for her.
I make two calls to the

Amy Dunne tip line, and
speak to two different
people, and offer two
different tips. Itʼs hard to
tell how quickly theyʼll
reach
the
police—the
volunteers seem utterly
disinterested. I drive to the
library in a dark mood. I
need to pack up and leave.
Clean my cabin with
bleach,
wipe
my
fingerprints off everything,

vacuum for any hairs.
Erase Amy (and Lydia and
Nancy) and go. If I go, Iʼll
be safe. Even if Greta and
Jeff do suspect who I am,
as long as Iʼm not caught
in the flesh, Iʼm okay. Amy
Elliott Dunne is like a yeti
—coveted and folkloric—
and they are two Ozarks
grifters whose blurry story
will
be
immediately
debunked. I will leave

today. Thatʼs what I decide
when I walk with my head
bowed into the chilly,
mostly uninhabited library
with its three vacant
computers and I go online
to catch up on Nick.
Since the vigil, the
news about Nick has been
on repeat—the same facts
on a circuit, over and over,
getting louder and louder,
but
with
no
new

information. But today
something is different. I
type Nickʼs name into the
search engine, and the
blogs are going nuts,
because my husband has
gotten drunk and done an
insane interview, in a bar,
with
a
random
girl
wielding a Flip camera.
God, the idiot never
learns.
NICK DUNNEʼS VIDEO

CONFESSION!!!
NICK
DUNNE,
DRUNKEN
DECLARATIONS!!!
My heart jumps so
high, my uvula begins
pulsing. My husband has
fucked himself again.
The video loads, and
there is Nick. He has the
sleepy eyes he gets when
heʼs drunk, the heavy lids,
and heʼs got his sideways

grin, and heʼs talking
about me, and he looks
like a human being. He
looks happy. “My wife, she
just happens to be the
coolest girl Iʼve ever met,”
he says. “How many guys
can say that? I married the
coolest girl I ever met.”
My stomach flutters
delicately. I was not
expecting this. I almost
smile.

“Whatʼs so cool about
her?” the girl asks offscreen. Her voice is high,
sorority-cheery.
Nick launches into the
treasure hunt, how it was
our tradition, how I always
remembered
hilarious
inside jokes, and right now
this was all he had left of
me, so he had to complete
the treasure hunt. It was
his mission.

“I just reached the end
this morning,” he says. His
voice is husky. He has
been talking over the
crowd. Heʼll go home and
gargle with warm salt
water, like his mother
always made him do. If I
were at home with him,
heʼd ask me to heat the
water and make it for him,
because he never got the
right amount of salt. “And

it made me … realize a lot.
She is the only person in
the world who has the
power to surprise me, you
know? Everyone else, I
always know what theyʼre
going to say, because
everyone says the same
thing. We all watch the
same shows, we read the
same stuff, we recycle
everything. But Amy, she
is her own perfect person.

She just has this power
over me.”
“Where do you think
she is now, Nick?”
My
husband
looks
down at his wedding band
and twirls it twice.
“Are you okay, Nick?”
“The truth? No. I failed
my wife so entirely. I have
been so wrong. I just hope
itʼs not too late. For me.
For us.”

“Youʼre at the end of
your rope. Emotionally.”
Nick looks right at the
camera. “I want my wife. I
want her to be right here.”
He takes a breath. “Iʼm not
the best at showing
emotion. I know that. But I
love her. I need her to be
okay. She has to be okay. I
have so much to make up
to her.”
“Like what?”

He
laughs,
the
chagrined laugh that even
now I find appealing. In
better days, I used to call it
the talk-show laugh: It was
the
quick
downward
glance, the scratching of a
corner of the mouth with a
casual thumb, the inhaled
chuckle that a charming
movie star always deploys
right before telling a killer
story.

“Like, none of your
business.” He smiles. “I just
have a lot to make up to
her. I wasnʼt the husband I
could have been. We had a
few hard years, and I … I
lost my shit. I stopped
trying. I mean, Iʼve heard
that phrase a thousand
times: We stopped trying.
Everyone knows it means
the end of a marriage—itʼs
textbook. But I stopped

trying. It was me. I wasnʼt
the man I needed to be.”
Nickʼs lids are heavy, his
speech off-kilter enough
that his twang is showing.
He is past tipsy, one drink
before drunk. His cheeks
are pink with alcohol. My
fingertips
glow,
remembering the heat of
his skin when he had a few
cocktails in him.
“So how would you

make it up to her?” The
camera wobbles for a
second; the girl is grabbing
her drink.
“How will I make it up
to her. First Iʼm going to
find her and bring her
home. You can bet on that.
Then? Whatever she needs
from me, Iʼll give her.
From now on. Because I
reached the end of the
treasure hunt, and I was

brought to my knees.
Humbled. My wife has
never been more clear to
me than she is now. Iʼve
never been so sure of what
I needed to do.”
“If you could talk to
Amy right now, what
would you tell her?”
“I love you. I will find
you. I will …”
I can tell he is about to
do the Daniel Day-Lewis

line from The Last of the
Mohicans: “Stay alive … I
will find you.” He canʼt
resist
deflecting
any
sincerity with a quick line
of movie dialogue. I can
feel him teetering right on
the edge of it. He stops
himself.
“I love you forever,
Amy.”
How heartfelt. How
unlike my husband.

Three morbidly obese
hill people on motorized
scooters are between me
and my morning coffee.
Their asses mushroom over
the
sides
of
the
contraptions, but they still
need
another
Egg
McMuffin.
There
are
literally
three
people,
parked in front of me, in
line,
inside
the
McDonaldʼs.

I actually donʼt care.
Iʼm curiously cheerful
despite this twist in the
plan. Online, the video is
already
spiral-viraling
away, and the reaction is
surprisingly
positive.
Cautiously
optimistic:
Maybe this guy didnʼt kill
his wife after all. That is,
word for word, the most
common refrain. Because
once Nick lets his guard

down and shows some
emotion, itʼs all there. No
one could watch that video
and believe he was putting
up an act. It was no
swallow-the-pain sort of
amateur
theater.
My
husband loves me. Or at
least last night he loved
me. While I was plotting
his doom in my crummy
little cabin that smells of
moldy towel, he loved me.

Itʼs not enough. I know
that, of course. I canʼt
change my plan. But it
gives me pause. My
husband has finished the
treasure hunt and he is in
love. He is also deeply
distressed: on one cheek I
swear I could spot a hive.
I pull up to my cabin to
find Dorothy knocking on
my door. Her hair is wet
from the heat, brushed

straight back like a Wall
Street slicksterʼs. She is in
the habit of swiping her
upper lip, then licking the
sweat off her fingers, so
she has her index finger in
her mouth like a buttery
corncob as she turns to
me.
“There she is,” she says.
“The truant.”
I am late on my cabin
payment. Two days. It

almost makes me laugh: I
am late on rent.
“Iʼm so sorry, Dorothy.
Iʼll come by with it in ten
minutes.”
“Iʼll wait, if you donʼt
mind.”
“Iʼm not sure if Iʼm
going to stay. I might have
to head on.”
“Then youʼd still owe
me the two days. Eighty
dollars, please.”

I duck into my cabin,
undo my flimsy money
belt. I counted my cash on
my bed this morning,
taking a good long time
doling out each bill, a
teasing
economic
striptease, and the big
reveal was that I have,
somehow, I have only
$8,849 left. It costs a lot to
live.
When I open the door

to hand Dorothy the cash
($8,769 left), I see Greta
and Jeff hanging out on
Gretaʼs porch, watching
the cash exchange hands.
Jeff isnʼt playing his
guitar,
Greta
isnʼt
smoking. They seem to be
standing on her porch just
to get a better look at me.
They both wave at me,
hey, sweetie, and I wave
limply back. I close the

door and start packing.
Itʼs strange how little I
own in this world when I
used to own so much. I
donʼt own an eggbeater or
a soup bowl. I own sheets
and towels, but I donʼt
own a decent blanket. I
own a pair of scissors so I
can
keep
my
hair
butchered. It makes me
smile because Nick didnʼt
own a pair of scissors

when
we
moved
in
together. No scissors, no
iron, no stapler, and I
remember asking him how
he thought he was possibly
civilized without a pair of
scissors, and he said of
course he wasnʼt and
swooped me up in his
arms and threw me on the
bed and pounced on top of
me, and I laughed because
I was still Cool Girl. I

laughed
instead
of
thinking about what it
meant.
One
should
never
marry a man who doesnʼt
own a decent set of
scissors. That would be my
advice. It leads to bad
things.
I fold and pack my
clothes
in
my
tiny
backpack—the same three
outfits I bought and kept

in my getaway car a
month ago so I didnʼt have
to take anything from
home. Toss in my travel
toothbrush,
calendar,
comb, lotion, the sleeping
pills I bought, back when I
was going to drug and
drown myself. My cheap
swimsuits. It takes such
little time, the whole
thing.
I put on my latex

gloves and wipe down
everything. I pull out the
drains to get any trapped
hair. I donʼt really think
Greta and Jeff know who I
am, but if they do, I donʼt
want to leave any proof,
and the whole time I say
to myself, This is what you
get for relaxing, this is what
you get for not thinking all
the time, all the time. You
deserve to get caught, a girl

who acts so stupidly, and
what if you left hairs in the
front office, then what, and
what if there are fingerprints
in Jeffʼs car or Gretaʼs
kitchen, what then, why did
you ever think you could be
someone who didnʼt worry?
I
picture
the
police
scouring
the
cabins,
finding nothing, and then,
like a movie, I go in for a
close-up of one lone mousy

hair of mine, drifting along
the concrete floor of the
pool, waiting to damn me.
Then my mind swings
the other way: Of course no
one is going to show up to
look for you here. All the
police have to go on is the
claim of a few grifters that
they saw the real Amy
Elliott Dunne at a cheap
broke-down cabin court in
the middle of nowhere.

Little people wanting to
feel bigger, thatʼs what
theyʼd assume.
An assertive knock at
the door. The kind a
parent gives right before
swinging the door wide: I
own this place. I stand in
the middle of my room
and debate not answering.
Bang
bang
bang.
I
understand now why so
many horror movies use

that
device—the
mysterious knock on the
door—because it has the
weight of a nightmare.
You donʼt know whatʼs out
there, yet you know youʼll
open it. Youʼll think what I
think: No one bad ever
knocks.
Hey, sweetheart, we
know youʼre home, open up!
I strip off my latex
gloves, open the door, and

Jeff and Greta are standing
on my porch, the sun to
their backs, their features
in shadow.
“Hey, pretty lady, can
we come in?” Jeff asks.
“I actually— I was
going to come see you
guys,” I say, trying to
sound flippant, harried.
“Iʼm leaving tonight—
tomorrow or tonight. Got a
call from back home, got

to get going back home.”
“Home Louisiana or
home Savannah?” Greta
says. She and Jeff have
been talking about me.
“Louisi—”
“It doesnʼt matter,” Jeff
says, “let us in for a
second, we come to say
goodbye.”
He steps toward me,
and
I
think
about
screaming or slamming the

door, but I donʼt think
either will go well. Better
to pretend everything is
fine and hope that is true.
Greta closes the door
behind them and leans
against it as Jeff wanders
into the tiny bedroom,
then the kitchen, chatting
about
the
weather.
Opening
doors
and
cabinets.
“You got to clear

everything out; Dorothy
will keep your deposit if
you donʼt,” he says. “Sheʼs
a stickler.” He opens the
refrigerator, peers into the
crisper, the freezer. “Not
even a jar of ketchup can
you leave. I always
thought that was weird.
Ketchup doesnʼt go bad.”
He opens the closet and
lifts up the cabin bedding
Iʼve folded, shakes out the

sheets. “I always, always
shake out the sheets,” he
says. “Just to make sure
nothing is inside—a sock
or underwear or what have
you.”
He opens the drawer of
my bedside table, kneels
down, and looks all the
way to the back. “Looks
like youʼve done a good
job,” he says, standing up
and smiling, brushing his

hands off on his jeans.
“Got everything.”
He scans me, neck to
foot and back up. “Where
is it, sweetheart?”
“Whatʼs that?”
“Your
money.”
He
shrugs. “Donʼt make it
hard. Me ʼn her really
need it.”
Greta is silent behind
me.
“I have about twenty

bucks.”
“Lie,” Jeff said. “You
pay for everything, even
rent, in cash. Greta saw
you with that big wad of
money. So hand it over,
and you can leave, and we
all never have to see each
other again.”
“Iʼll call the police.”
“Go ahead! My guest.”
Jeff waits, arms crossed,
thumbs in his armpits.

“Your glasses are fake,”
Greta says. “Theyʼre just
glass.”
I say nothing, stare at
her, hoping sheʼll back
down. These two seem just
nervous enough they may
change their minds, say
theyʼre screwing with me,
and the three of us will
laugh and know otherwise
but all agree to pretend.
“And your hair, the

roots are coming in, and
theyʼre blond, a lot prettier
than whatever color you
dyed it—hamster—and that
haircut is awful, by the
way,” Greta says. “Youʼre
hiding—from whatever. I
donʼt know if it really is a
guy or what, but youʼre
not going to call the
police. So just give us the
money.”
“Jeff talk you into

this?” I ask.
“I talked Jeff into it.”
I start toward the door
that Gretaʼs blocking. “Let
me out.”
“Give us the money.”
I make a grab for the
door, and Greta swings
toward me, shoves me
against the wall, one hand
smashed over my face, and
with the other, she pulls
up my dress, yanks off the

money belt.
“Donʼt,
Greta,
Iʼm
serious! Stop!”
Her hot, salty palm is
all over my face, jamming
my nose; one of her
fingernails scrapes my eye.
Then she pushes me back
against the wall, my head
banging, my teeth coming
down on the tip of my
tongue. The whole scuffle
is very quiet.

I have the buckle end
of the belt in my hand, but
I canʼt see to fight her, my
eye is watering too much,
and she soon rips away my
grip, leaving a burning
scrape of fingernails on my
knuckles. She shoves me
again and opens the
zipper, fingers through the
money.
“Holy shit,” she says.
“This is like”—she counts

—“moreʼn a thousand, two
or three. Holy shit. Damn,
girl! You rob a bank?”
“She may have,” Jeff
says. “Embezzlement.”
In a movie, one of
Nickʼs movies, I would
upthrust my palm into
Gretaʼs nose, drop her to
the floor bloody and
unconscious,
then
roundhouse Jeff. But the
truth is, I donʼt know how

to fight, and there are two
of them, and it doesnʼt
seem worth it. I will run at
them, and they will grab
me by the wrists while I
pat and fuss at them like a
child, or they will get
really angry and beat the
crap out of me. Iʼve never
been hit. Iʼm scared of
getting hurt by someone
else.
“You going to call the

police, go ahead and call
them,” Jeff says again.
“Fuck you,” I whisper.
“Sorry about this,”
Greta says. “Next place
you go, be more careful,
okay? You gotta not look
like a girl traveling by
herself, hiding out.”
“Youʼll be okay,” Jeff
says.
He pats me on the arm
as they leave.

A quarter and a dime
sit on the bedside table.
Itʼs all my money in the
world.

NICK DUNNE
NINE
DAYS
GONE

Good morning! I sat in
bed with my laptop by my
side, enjoying the online
reviews of my impromptu

interview. My left eyeball
was throbbing a bit, a light
hangover from the cheap
Scotch, but the rest of me
was
feeling
pretty
satisfied. Last night I cast
the first line to lure my
wife back in. Iʼm sorry, I
will make it up to you, I will
do whatever you want from
now on, I will let the world
know how special you are.
Because I was fucked

unless Amy decided to
show herself. Tannerʼs
detective (a wiry, clean-cut
guy, not the boozy noir
gumshoe Iʼd hoped for)
had come up with nothing
so far—my wife had
disappeared
herself
perfectly.
I
had
to
convince Amy to come
back to me, flush her out
with compliments and
capitulation.

If the reviews were any
indication, I made the
right call, because the
reviews were good. They
were very good:
The Iceman Melteth!
I KNEW he was a good
guy.
In vino veritas!
Maybe he didnʼt kill her
after all.
Maybe he didnʼt kill her
after all.

Maybe he didnʼt kill her
after all.
And theyʼd stopped
calling me Lance.
Outside my house, the
cameramen and journalists
were restless, they wanted
a statement from the guy
who Maybe Didnʼt Kill Her
After All. They were
yelling at my drawn
blinds: Hey, Nick, come on
out, tell us about Amy. Hey,

Nick, tell us about your
treasure hunt. For them it
was just a new wrinkle in
a ratings bonanza, but it
was much better than
Nick, did you kill your wife?
And then, suddenly,
they were yelling Goʼs
name—they loved Go, she
had no poker face, you
knew if Go was sad, angry,
worried; stick a caption
underneath, and you had a

whole story. Margo, is your
brother innocent? Margo,
tell us about … Tanner, is
your client innocent? Tanner
—
The doorbell rang, and
I opened the door while
hiding behind it because I
was still disheveled; my
spiky hair and wilted
boxers would tell their
own story. Last night, on
camera, I was adorably

smitten, a tad tipsy, in
vino veritastic. Now I just
looked like a drunk. I
closed the door and waited
for two more glowing
reviews
of
my
performance.
“You donʼt ever—ever
—do something like that
again,” Tanner started.
“What the hell is wrong
with you, Nick? I feel like I
need to put one of those

toddler leashes on you.
How stupid can you be?”
“Have you seen all the
comments online? People
love it. Iʼm turning around
public opinion, like you
told me to.”
“You donʼt do that kind
of thing in an uncontrolled
environment,” he said.
“What if she worked for
Ellen Abbott? What if she
started
asking
you

questions that were harder
than What do you want to
say to your wife, cutiepumpkin-pie?” He said this
in a girlish singsong. His
face under the orange
spray tan was red, giving
him a radioactive palette.
“I trusted my instincts.
Iʼm a journalist, Tanner,
you have to give me some
credit that I can smell
bullshit. She was genuinely

sweet.”
He sat down on the
sofa, put his feet on the
ottoman that would never
have flipped over on its
own. “Yeah, well, so was
your wife once,” he said.
“So was Andie once. Howʼs
your cheek?”
It still hurt; the bite
seemed to throb as he
reminded me of it. I turned
to Go for support.

“It wasnʼt smart, Nick,”
she said, sitting down
across from Tanner. “You
were really, really lucky—it
turned out really well, but
it might not have.”
“You guys are really
overreacting. Can we enjoy
a small moment of good
news? Just thirty seconds
of good news in the past
nine days? Please?”
Tanner
pointedly

looked at his watch.
“Okay, go.”
When I started to talk,
he popped his index finger,
made the uhp-uhp noise
that grown-ups make when
children try to interrupt.
Slowly, his index finger
lowered, then landed on
the watch face.
“Okay, thirty seconds.
Did you enjoy it?” He
paused to see if Iʼd say

anything—the
pointed
silence a teacher allows
after asking the disruptive
student: Are you done
talking? “Now we need to
talk. We are in a place
where excellent timing is
absolutely key.”
“I agree.”
“Gee,
thanks.”
He
arched an eyebrow at me.
“I want to go to the police
very, very soon with the

contents of the woodshed.
While the hoi polloi is—”
Just
hoi
polloi,
I
thought, not the hoi polloi.
It was something Amy had
taught me.
“—all loving on you
again. Or, excuse me, not
again.
Finally.
The
reporters have found Goʼs
house, and I donʼt feel
secure
leaving
that
woodshed, its contents,

undisclosed much longer.
The Elliotts are …?”
“We canʼt count on the
Elliottsʼ support anymore,”
I said. “Not at all.”
Another pause. Tanner
decided not to lecture me,
or
even
ask
what
happened.
“So we need offense,” I
said, feeling untouchable,
angry, ready.
“Nick, donʼt let one

good turn make you feel
indestructible,” Go said.
She pressed some extrastrengths from her purse
into my hand. “Get rid of
your hangover. You need
to be on today.”
“Itʼs going to be okay,”
I told her. I popped the
pills, turned to Tanner.
“What do we do? Letʼs
make a plan.”
“Great, hereʼs the deal,”

Tanner said. “This is
incredibly unorthodox, but
thatʼs me. Tomorrow we
are doing an interview
with Sharon Schieber.”
“Wow, thatʼs … for
sure?” Sharon Schieber
was as good as I could ask
for: the top-rated (ages 30–
55)
network
(broader
reach
than
cable)
newswoman (to prove I
could
have
respectful

relations with people who
have vaginas) working
today. She was known for
dabbling very occasionally
in the impure waters of
true-crime journalism, but
when she did, she got
freakinʼ righteous. Two
years ago, she took under
her silken wing a young
mother who had been
imprisoned for shaking her
infant to death. Sharon

Schieber
presented
a
whole legal—and very
emotional—defense case
over a series of nights. The
woman is now back home
in Nebraska, remarried
and expecting a child.
“Thatʼs for sure. She
got in touch after the
video went viral.”
“So the video did help.”
I couldnʼt resist.
“It
gave
you
an

interesting wrinkle: Before
the video, it was clear you
did it. Now thereʼs a slight
chance you didnʼt. I donʼt
know how it is you finally
seemed genuine—”
“Because last night it
served an actual purpose:
Get Amy back,” Go said.
“It was an offensive
maneuver. Where before it
would just be indulgent,
undeserved, disingenuous

emotion.”
I gave her a thank-you
smile.
“Well,
keep
remembering that it is
serving a purpose,” Tanner
said. “Nick, Iʼm not
fucking around here: This
is beyond unorthodox.
Most lawyers would be
shutting you up. But itʼs
something
Iʼve
been
wanting to try. The media

has saturated the legal
environment. With the
Internet,
Facebook,
YouTube, thereʼs no such
thing as an unbiased jury
anymore. No clean slate.
Eighty, ninety percent of a
case is decided before you
get in the courtroom. So
why not use it—control
the story. But itʼs a risk. I
want every word, every
gesture, every bit of

information planned out
ahead of time. But you
have to be natural, likable,
or this will all backfire.”
“Oh,
that
sounds
simple,” I said. “One
hundred percent canned
yet totally genuine.”
“You have to be
extremely careful with
your wording, and we will
tell Sharon that you wonʼt
answer certain questions.

Sheʼll ask you anyway, but
weʼll teach you how to
say, Because of certain
prejudicial actions by the
police involved in this case, I
really, unfortunately, canʼt
answer that right now, as
much as Iʼd like to—and
say it convincingly.”
“Like a talking dog.”
“Sure, like a talking
dog who doesnʼt want to
go to prison. We get

Sharon Schieber to take
you on as a cause, Nick,
and we are golden. This is
all incredibly unorthodox,
but thatʼs me,” Tanner said
again. He liked the line; it
was his theme music. He
paused and furrowed his
brow, doing his pretendthinking gesture. He was
going to add something I
wouldnʼt like.
“What?” I asked.

“You need to tell
Sharon Schieber about
Andie—because itʼs going
to come out, the affair, it
just will.”
“Right when people are
finally starting to like me.
You want me to undo
that?”
“I swear to you, Nick—
how many cases have I
handled?
It
always—
somehow, some way—

always comes out. This
way we have control. You
tell her about Andie and
you apologize. Apologize
literally as if your life
depends on it. You had an
affair, you are a man, a
weak, stupid man. But you
love your wife, and you
will make it up to her. You
do the interview, itʼll air
the next night. All content
is
embargoed—so
the

network canʼt tease the
Andie affair in their ads.
They can just use the word
bombshell.”
“So you already told
them about Andie?”
“Good God, no,” he
said. “I told them: We have
a nice bombshell for you. So
you do the interview, and
we have about twenty-four
hours. Just before it hits
TV, we tell Boney and

Gilpin about Andie and
about our discovery in the
woodshed. Oh my gosh,
weʼve put it all together for
you: Amy is alive and sheʼs
framing Nick! Sheʼs crazy,
jealous, and she is framing
Nick! Oh, the humanity!”
“Why not tell Sharon
Schieber, then? About
Amy framing me?”
“Reason one. You come
clean about Andie, you

beg forgiveness, the nation
is primed to forgive you,
theyʼll feel sorry for you—
Americans love to see
sinners apologize. But you
can reveal nothing to make
your wife look bad; no one
wants to see the cheating
husband blame the wife
for anything. Let someone
else do it sometime the
next day: Sources close to
the police reveal that Nickʼs

wife—the one he swore he
loved with all his heart—is
framing him! Itʼs great
TV.”
“Whatʼs reason two?”
“Itʼs too complicated to
explain exactly how Amy
is framing you. You canʼt
do it in a sound bite. Itʼs
bad TV.”
“I feel sick,” I said.
“Nick,
itʼs—”
Go
started.

“I know, I know, it has
to be done. But can you
imagine,
your
biggest
secret and you have to tell
the world about it? I know
I have to do it. And it
works for us, ultimately, I
think. Itʼs the only way
Amy might come back,” I
said. “She wants me to be
publicly humiliated—”
“Chastened,”
Tanner
interrupted. “Humiliated

makes it sound like you
feel sorry for yourself.”
“—and
to
publicly
apologize,” I continued.
“But itʼs going to be
fucking awful.”
“Before we go forward,
I want to be honest here,”
Tanner said. “Telling the
police the whole story—
Amyʼs framing Nick—it is
a risk. Most cops, they
decide on a suspect and

they donʼt want to veer at
all. Theyʼre not open to
any other options. So
thereʼs the risk that we tell
them and they laugh us
out of the station and they
arrest
you—and
then
theoretically weʼve just
given them a preview of
our defense. So they can
plan exactly how to
destroy it at trial.”
“Okay,
wait,
that

sounds really, really bad,
Tanner,” Go said. “Like,
bad, inadvisable bad.”
“Let me finish,” Tanner
said. “One, I think youʼre
right, Nick. I think Boney
isnʼt convinced youʼre a
killer. I think she would be
open to an alternate
theory. She has a good
reputation as a cop whoʼs
actually fair. As a cop who
has good instincts. I talked

with her. I got a good vibe.
I think the evidence is
leading her in your
direction, but I think her
gut
is
telling
her
somethingʼs off. More
important, if we do go to
trial, I wouldnʼt use the
Amy frame-up as your
defense, anyway.”
“What do you mean?”
“Like I said, itʼs too
complicated,
a
jury

wouldnʼt be able to follow.
If itʼs not good TV, believe
me, itʼs not for a jury.
Weʼd go with more of an
O.J. thing. A simple story
line:
The
cops
are
incompetent and out to get
you, itʼs all circumstantial,
if the glove doesnʼt fit,
blah blah, blah.”
“Blah blah blah, that
gives me a lot of
confidence,” I said.

Tanner flashed a smile.
“Juries love me, Nick. Iʼm
one of them.”
“Youʼre the opposite of
one of them, Tanner.”
“Reverse that: Theyʼd
like to think theyʼre one of
me.”
Everything we did now,
we did in front of small
brambles
of
flashing
paparazzi, so Go, Tanner,
and I left the house under

pops of light and pings of
noise. (“Donʼt look down,”
Tanner advised, “donʼt
smile, but donʼt look
ashamed.
Donʼt
rush
either, just walk, let them
take their shots, and shut
the door before you call
them names. Then you can
call them whatever you
want.”) We were headed
down to St. Louis, where
the interview would take

place, so I could prep with
Tannerʼs wife, Betsy, a
former TV news anchor
turned lawyer. She was the
other Bolt in Bolt & Bolt.
It was a creepy tailgate
party: Tanner and I,
followed by Go, followed
by a half-dozen news vans,
but by the time the Arch
crept over the skyline, I
was no longer thinking of
the paparazzi.

By the time we reached
Tannerʼs penthouse hotel
suite, I was ready to do the
work I needed to nail the
interview. Again I longed
for my own theme music:
the montage of me getting
ready for the big fight.
Whatʼs
the
mental
equivalent of a speed bag?
A gorgeous six-foot-tall
black woman answered the
door.

“Hi, Nick, Iʼm Betsy
Bolt.”
In my mind Betsy Bolt
was a diminutive blond
Southern-belle white girl.
“Donʼt worry, everyone
is surprised when they
meet me.” Betsy laughed,
catching my look, shaking
my hand. “Tanner and
Betsy, we sound like we
should be on the cover of
The Official Preppy Guide,

right?”
“Preppy
Handbook,”
Tanner corrected as he
kissed her on the cheek.
“See?
He
actually
knows,” she said.
She ushered us into an
impressive penthouse suite
—a living room sunlit by
wall-to-wall windows, with
bedrooms shooting off
each side. Tanner had
sworn he couldnʼt stay in

Carthage, at the Days Inn,
out of respect for Amyʼs
parents, but Go and I both
suspected he couldnʼt stay
in Carthage because the
closest five-star hotel was
in St. Louis.
We engaged in the
preliminaries: small talk
about
Betsyʼs
family,
college, career (all stellar,
A-list,
awesome),
and
drinks
dispersed
for

everyone (soda pops and
Clamato, which Go and I
had come to believe was
an affectation of Tannerʼs,
a quirk he thought would
give him character, like
my wearing fake glasses in
college). Then Go and I
sank down into the leather
sofa, Betsy sitting across
from us, her legs pressed
together to one side, like a
slash
mark.

Pretty/professional.
Tanner paced behind us,
listening.
“Okay. So, Nick,” Betsy
said. “Iʼll be frank, yes?”
“Yes.”
“You and TV. Aside
from your bar-blog thingie,
the
Whodunnit.com
thingie last night, youʼre
awful.”
“There was a reason I
went to print journalism,”

I said. “I see a camera, and
my face freezes.”
“Exactly,” Betsy said.
“You look like a mortician,
so stiff. I got a trick to fix
that, though.”
“Booze?” I asked. “That
worked for me on the blog
thingie.”
“That
wonʼt
work
here,” Betsy said. She
began setting up a video
camera. “Thought weʼd do

a dry run first. Iʼll be
Sharon.
Iʼll
ask
the
questions sheʼll probably
ask, and you answer the
way you normally would.
That way we can know
how far off the mark you
are.” She laughed again.
“Hold on.” She was
wearing a blue sheath
dress,
and
from
an
oversize leather purse she
pulled a string of pearls.

The
Sharon
Schieber
uniform. “Tanner?”
Her husband fastened
the pearls for her, and
when they were in place,
Betsy grinned. “I aim for
absolute
authenticity.
Aside from my Georgia
accent. And being black.”
“I see only Sharon
Schieber before me,” I
said.
She turned the camera

on, sat down across from
me, let out a breath,
looked down, and then
looked up. “Nick, there
have
been
many
discrepancies in this case,”
Betsy said in Sharonʼs
plummy broadcast voice.
“To begin with, can you
walk our audience through
the day your wife went
missing?”
“Here, Nick, you only

discuss the anniversary
breakfast you two had,”
Tanner interrupted. “Since
that is already out there.
But you donʼt give time
lines, you donʼt discuss
before and after breakfast.
You are emphasizing only
this
wonderful
last
breakfast you had. Okay,
go.”
“Yes.” I cleared my
throat. The camera was

blinking red; Betsy had her
quizzical-journalist
expression on. “Uh, as you
know, it was our five-year
anniversary, and Amy got
up early and was making
crepes—”
Betsyʼs arm shot out,
and my cheek suddenly
stung.
“What the hell?” I said,
trying to figure out what
had happened. A cherry-

red jellybean was in my
lap. I held it up.
“Every time you tense
up, every time you turn
that handsome face into an
undertakerʼs mask, I am
going to hit you with a
jellybean,”
Betsy
explained, as if the whole
thing
were
quite
reasonable.
“And thatʼs supposed to
make me less tense?”

“It works,” Tanner said.
“Itʼs how she taught me. I
think she used rocks with
me,
though.”
They
exchanged
oh,
you!
married smiles. I could tell
already: They were one of
those couples who always
seemed to be starring in
their own morning talk
show.
“Now start again, but
linger over the crepes,”

Betsy said. “Were they
your favorites? Or hers?
And what were you doing
that morning for your wife
while she was making
crepes for you?”
“I was sleeping.”
“What had you bought
her for a gift?”
“I hadnʼt yet.”
“Oh, boy.” She rolled
her eyes over to her
husband. “Then be really,

really,
really
complimentary
about
those crepes, okay? And
about what you were going
to get her that day for a
present. Because I know
you were not coming back
to that house without a
present.”
We started again, and I
described
our
crepe
tradition
that
wasnʼt
really, and I described how

careful and wonderful
Amy was with picking out
gifts
(here
another
jellybean smacked just
right of my nose, and I
immediately loosened my
jaw) and how I, dumb guy
(“Definitely play up the
doofus-husband
stuff,”
Betsy advised), was still
trying to come up with
something dazzling.
“It wasnʼt like she even

liked expensive or fancy
presents,” I began, and was
hit with a paper ball from
Tanner.
“What?”
“Past tense. Stop using
fucking past tense about
your wife.”
“I understand you and
your wife had some
bumps,” Betsy continued.
“It had been a rough
few years. Weʼd both lost

our jobs.”
“Good, yes!” Tanner
called. “You both had.”
“Weʼd moved back here
to help care for my dad,
who has Alzheimerʼs, and
my late mother, who had
cancer, and on top of that I
was working very hard at
my new job.”
“Good, Nick, good,”
Tanner said.
“Be sure to mention

how close you were with
your mom,” Betsy said,
even though Iʼd never
mentioned my mom to
her. “No one will pop up
to deny that, right? No
Mommy Dearest or Sonny
Dearest stories out there?”
“No, my mom and I
were very close.”
“Good,” said Betsy.
“Mention her a lot, then.
And that you own the bar

with your sister—always
mention your sister when
you mention the bar. If
you own a bar on your
own, youʼre a player; if
you own it with your
beloved twin sister, youʼre
—”
“Irish.”
“Go on.”
“And so it all built up
—” I started.
“No,”
Tanner
said.

“Implies building up to an
explosion.”
“So we had gotten off
track a little, but I was
considering our five-year
anniversary as a time to
revive our relationship—”
“Recommit
to
our
relationship,”
Tanner
called.
“Revive
means
something was dead.”
“Recommit
to
our
relationship—”

“And so how does
fucking a twenty-threeyear-old figure in to this
rejuvenative
picture?”
Betsy asked.
Tanner
lobbed
a
jellybean her way. “A little
out of character, Bets.”
“Iʼm sorry, guys, but
Iʼm a woman, and that
smells like bullshit, like
mile-away
bullshit.
Recommit
to
the

relationship, please. That
girl was still in the picture
when Amy went missing.
Women are going to hate
you, Nick, unless you suck
it up. Be up-front, donʼt
stall. You can add it on:
We lost our jobs, we moved,
my parents were dying. Then
I fucked up. I fucked up
huge. I lost track of who I
was, and unfortunately, it
took losing Amy to realize it.

You have to admit youʼre a
jerk and that everything
was all your fault.”
“So, like, what men are
supposed to do in general,”
I said.
Betsy flung an annoyed
look at the ceiling. “And
thatʼs an attitude, Nick,
you should be real careful
on.”

AMY
ELLIOTT
DUNNE
NINE
DAYS
GONE

I am penniless and on
the run. How fucking noir.

Except that I am sitting in
my Festiva at the far end
of the parking lot of a vast
fast-food complex on the
banks of the Mississippi
River, the smell of salt and
factory-farm meat floating
on the warm breezes. It is
evening now—Iʼve wasted
hours—but I canʼt move. I
donʼt know where to move
to. The car gets smaller by
the hour—I am forced to

curl up like a fetus or my
legs fall asleep. I certainly
wonʼt sleep tonight. The
door is locked, but I still
await the tap on the
window, and I know I will
peek up and see either a
crooked-toothed,
sweettalking
serial
killer
(wouldnʼt that be ironic,
for me to actually be
murdered?) or a stern, IDdemanding cop (wouldnʼt

that be worse, for me to be
discovered in a parking lot
looking like a hobo?). The
glowing restaurant signs
never go off here; the
parking lot is lit like a
football field—I think of
suicide again, how a
prisoner on suicide watch
spends twenty-four hours a
day under lights, an awful
thought. My gas tank is
below the quarter mark,

an even more awful
thought: I can drive only
about an hour in any
direction, so I must choose
the direction carefully.
South is Arkansas, north is
Iowa, west is back to the
Ozarks. Or I could go east,
cross the river into Illinois.
Everywhere I go is the
river. Iʼm following it or
itʼs following me.
I know, suddenly, what

I must do.

NICK DUNNE
TEN DAYS GONE

We spent the day of the
interview huddled in the
spare bedroom of Tannerʼs
suite, prepping my lines,
fixing my look. Betsy
fussed over my clothes,
then Go trimmed the hair

above my ears with nail
scissors while Betsy tried
to talk me into using
makeup—powder—to cut
down on shine. We all
spoke in low voices
because Sharonʼs crew was
setting up outside; the
interview would be in the
suiteʼs
living
room,
overlooking the St. Louis
Arch. Gateway to the
West. Iʼm not sure what

the point of the landmark
was except to serve as a
vague symbol of the
middle of the country: You
Are Here.
“You need at least a
little powder, Nick,” Betsy
finally said, coming at me
with the puff. “Your nose
sweats when you get
nervous. Nixon lost an
election on nose sweat.”
Tanner oversaw it all like

a conductor. “Not too
much off that side, Go,”
heʼd call. “Bets, be very
careful with that powder,
better too little than too
much.”
“We
should
have
Botoxed him,” she said.
Apparently, Botox fights
sweat as well as wrinkles
—some of their clients got
a series of underarm shots
before a trial, and they

were already suggesting
such a thing for me.
Gently, subtly suggesting,
should we go to trial.
“Yeah, I really need the
press to get wind that I
was
having
Botox
treatments while my wife
was missing,” I said. “Is
missing.” I knew Amy
wasnʼt dead, but I also
knew she was so far out of
my reach that she might as

well be. She was a wife in
past tense.
“Good catch,” Tanner
said. “Next time do it
before it comes out of your
mouth.”
At five P.M., Tannerʼs
phone rang, and he looked
at the display. “Boney.” He
sent it to voice mail. “Iʼll
call her after.” He didnʼt
want any new bit of
information, interrogation,

gossip to force us to
reformulate our message. I
agreed: I didnʼt want
Boney in my head just
then.
“You sure we shouldnʼt
see what she wants?” Go
said.
“She wants to fuck with
me some more,” I said.
“Weʼll call her. A few
hours. She can wait.”
We
all
rearranged

ourselves, a mass group
reassurance that the call
was nothing to worry
about. The room stayed
silent for half a minute.
“I have to say, Iʼm
strangely excited to get to
meet Sharon Schieber,” Go
finally said. “Very classy
lady. Not like that Connie
Chung.”
I laughed, which was
the intention. Our mother

had loved Sharon Schieber
and hated Connie Chung—
sheʼd never forgiven her
for embarrassing Newt
Gingrichʼs mother on TV,
something about Newt
calling Hillary Clinton a bi-t-c-h. I donʼt remember
the actual interview, just
our momʼs outrage over it.
At six P.M. we entered
the room, where two
chairs were set up facing

each other, the Arch in the
background, the timing
picked precisely so the
Arch would glow but there
would be no sunset glare
on the windows. One of
the
most
important
moments of my life, I
thought, dictated by the
angle of the sun. A
producer whose name I
wouldnʼt
remember
clicked toward us on

dangerously high heels
and explained to me what
I should expect. Questions
could be asked several
times,
to
make
the
interview seem as smooth
as possible, and to allow
for Sharonʼs reaction shots.
I could not speak to my
lawyer before giving an
answer. I could rephrase
an answer but not change
the substance of the

answer.
Hereʼs
some
water, letʼs get you miked.
We started to move
over to the chair, and
Betsy nudged my arm.
When I looked down, she
showed me a pocket of
jellybeans. “Remember …”
she said, and tsked her
finger at me.
Suddenly, the suite
door swung wide and
Sharon Schieber entered,

as smooth as if she were
being borne by a team of
swans. She was a beautiful
woman, a woman who had
probably never looked
girlish. A woman whose
nose probably never sweat.
She had thick dark hair
and giant brown eyes that
could look doelike or
wicked.
“Itʼs Sharon!” Go said, a
thrilled whisper to imitate

our mom.
Sharon turned to Go
and nodded majestically,
came over to greet us. “Iʼm
Sharon,” she said in a
warm, deep voice, taking
both of Goʼs hands.
“Our mother loved
you,” Go said.
“Iʼm so glad,” Sharon
said, managing to sound
warm. She turned to me
and was about to speak

when her producer clicked
up on high heels and
whispered in her ear. Then
waited
for
Sharonʼs
reaction, then whispered
again.
“Oh. Oh my God,”
Sharon said. When she
turned back to me, she
wasnʼt smiling at all.

AMY
ELLIOTT
DUNNE
TEN DAYS GONE

I have made a call: to
make a call. The meeting
canʼt happen until this
evening—there
are

predictable complications
—so I kill the day by
primping and prepping.
I clean myself in a
McDonaldʼs
bathroom—
green gel on wet paper
towels—and change into a
cheap, papery sundress. I
think about what Iʼll say. I
am surprisingly eager. The
shithole life was wearing
on me: the communal
washing machine with

someoneʼs wet underwear
always stuck in the rungs
at the top, to be peeled out
by
hesitant
pincered
fingers; the corner of my
cabin rug that was forever
mysteriously damp; the
dripping faucet in the
bathroom.
At five oʼclock, I begin
driving north to the
meeting spot, a river
casino called Horseshoe

Alley. It appears out of
nowhere, a blinking neon
clump in the middle of a
scrawny forest. I roll in on
fumes—a cliché Iʼve never
put to practice—park the
car, and take in the view: a
migration of the elderly,
scuttling
like
broken
insects on walkers and
canes,
jerking
oxygen
tanks toward the bright
lights. Sliding in and out of

the
groups
of
octogenarians are hustling,
overdressed boys whoʼve
watched too many Vegas
movies and donʼt know
how poignant they are,
trying to imitate Rat Pack
cool in cheap suits in the
Missouri woods.
I enter under a glowing
billboard promoting—for
two
nights
only—the
reunion of a ʼ50s doo-wop

group. Inside, the casino is
frigid and close. The penny
slots clink and clang,
joyful electronic chirps
that donʼt match the dull,
drooping faces of the
people sitting in front of
the machines, smoking
cigarettes above dangling
oxygen masks. Penny in
penny in penny in penny
in penny in ding-dingding! penny in penny in.

The money that they waste
goes to the underfunded
public schools that their
bored,
blinking
grandchildren
attend.
Penny in penny in. A
group of wasted boys
stumble past, a bachelor
party, the boysʼ lips wet
from shots; they donʼt
even notice me, husky and
Hamill-haired. They are
talking about girls, get us

some girls, but besides me,
the only girls I see are
golden. The boys will
drink
away
their
disappointment and try
not to kill fellow motorists
on the way home.
I wait in a pocket bar
to the far left of the casino
entrance, as planned, and
watch the aged boy band
sing to a large snowyhaired audience, snapping

and
clapping
along,
shuffling gnarled fingers
through
bowls
of
complimentary
peanuts.
The
skeletal
singers,
withered
beneath
bedazzled
tuxes,
spin
slowly,
carefully,
on
replaced hips, the dance of
the moribund.
The casino seemed like
a good idea at first—right
off the highway, filled

with drunks and elderly,
neither of whom are
known for eyesight. But I
am feeling crowded and
fidgety, aware of the
cameras in every corner,
the doors that could snap
shut.
I am about to leave
when he ambles up.
“Amy.”
Iʼve called devoted Desi
to my aid (and abet). Desi,

with whom Iʼve never
entirely lost touch, and
who—despite what Iʼve
told Nick, my parents—
doesnʼt unnerve me in the
slightest. Desi, another
man along the Mississippi.
I always knew he might
come in handy. Itʼs good
to have at least one man
you can use for anything.
Desi is a white-knight
type. He loves troubled

women. Over the years,
after Wickshire, when
weʼd talk, Iʼd ask after his
latest girlfriend, and no
matter the girl, he would
always say: “Oh, sheʼs not
doing
very
well,
unfortunately.” But I know
it is fortunate for Desi—
the eating disorders, the
painkiller addictions, the
crippling depressions. He
is never happier than

when heʼs at a bedside.
Not in bed, just perched
nearby with broth and
juice and a gently starched
voice. Poor darling.
Now
he
is
here,
dashing
in
a
white
midsummer suit (Desi
changes
wardrobes
monthly—what
was
appropriate
for
June
would not work for July—
Iʼve always admired the

discipline, the precision of
the Collingsʼs costuming).
He looks good. I donʼt. I
am too aware of my humid
glasses, the extra roll of
flesh at my waist.
“Amy.” He touches my
cheek, then pulls me in for
an embrace. Not a hug,
Desi doesnʼt hug, itʼs more
like being encased by
something tailored just to
you. “Sweetheart. You

canʼt imagine. That call. I
thought Iʼd gone insane. I
thought I was making you
up! Iʼd daydreamed about
it, that somehow you were
alive, and then. That call.
Are you okay?”
“I am now,” I say. “I
feel safe now. Itʼs been
awful.” And then I burst
into tears, actual tears,
which hadnʼt been the
plan, but they feel so

relieving, and they fit the
moment so perfectly, that I
let myself unravel entirely.
The stress drips off me: the
nerve of enacting the plan,
the fear of being caught,
the loss of my money, the
betrayal, the manhandling,
the pure wildness of being
on my own for the first
time in my life.
I look quite pretty after
a cry of about two minutes

—longer than that and the
nose goes runny, the
puffiness sets in, but up to
that, my lips gets fuller,
my eyes bigger, my cheeks
flushed. I count as I cry
into Desiʼs crisp shoulder,
one
Mississippi,
two
Mississippi—that
river
again—and I curb the tears
at one minute and fortyeight seconds.
“Iʼm sorry I couldnʼt

get
here
earlier,
sweetheart,” Desi says.
“I know how full
Jacqueline keeps your
schedule,” I demur. Desiʼs
mom is a touchy subject in
our relationship.
He studies me. “You
look very … different,” he
says. “So full in the face,
especially. And your poor
hair is—” he catches
himself. “Amy. I just never

thought I could be so
grateful for anything. Tell
me whatʼs happened.”
I tell a Gothic tale of
possessiveness and rage, of
Midwest steak-and-potato
brutality,
barefoot
pregnancy,
animalistic
dominance. Of rape and
pills and liquor and fists.
Pointed cowboy boots in
the ribs, fear and betrayal,
parental apathy, isolation,

and Nickʼs final telling
words: “You can never
leave me. I will kill you. I
will find you no matter
what. You are mine.”
How I had to disappear
for my own safety and the
safety of my unborn child,
and how I needed Desiʼs
help. My savior. My story
would
satisfy
Desiʼs
craving for ruined women
—I was now the most

damaged of them all. Long
ago, back in boarding
school, Iʼd told him about
my fatherʼs nightly visits
to my bedroom, me in a
ruffly pink nightgown,
staring at the ceiling until
he was done. Desi has
loved me ever since the
lie, I know he pictures
making love to me, how
gentle and reassuring he
would be as he plunged

into me, stroking my hair.
I know he pictures me
crying softly as I give
myself to him.
“I canʼt ever go back to
my old life, Desi. Nick will
kill me. Iʼll never feel safe.
But I canʼt let him go to
prison. I just wanted to
disappear. I didnʼt realize
the police would think he
did it.”
I glance prettily toward

the band onstage, where a
skeletal septuagenarian is
singing about love. Not far
from our table, a straightbacked guy with a trim
mustache tosses his cup
toward a trash can near us
and bricks (a term I
learned from Nick). I wish
Iʼd
picked
a
more
picturesque spot. And now
the guy is looking at me,
tilting his head toward the

side,
in
exaggerated
confusion. If he were a
cartoon, heʼd scratch his
head, and it would make a
rubbery wiik-wiik sound.
For some reason, I think:
He looks like a cop. I turn
my back to him.
“Nick is the last thing
for you to worry about,”
Desi said. “Give that worry
to me and Iʼll take care of
it.” He holds out his hand,

an old gesture. He is my
worry-keeper; it is a ritual
game we played as teens. I
pretend to place something
in his palm and he closes
his fingers over it and I
actually feel better.
“No, I wonʼt take care
of it. I do hope Nick dies
for what he did to you,” he
said. “In a sane society, he
would.”
“Well, weʼre in an

insane society, so I need to
stay hidden,” I said. “Do
you think thatʼs horrible of
me?” I already know the
answer.
“Sweetheart, of course
not. You are doing what
youʼve been forced to do.
It would be madness to do
anything else.”
He
doesnʼt
ask
anything
about
the
pregnancy. I knew he

wouldnʼt.
“Youʼre the only one
who knows,” I say.
“Iʼll take care of you.
What can I do?”
I pretend to balk, chew
the edge of my lip, look
away and then back to
Desi. “I need money to live
on for a bit. I thought
about getting a job, but—”
“Oh, no, donʼt do that.
You are everywhere, Amy—

on all the newscasts, all
the magazines. Someone
would recognize you. Even
with this”—he touches my
hair—“new sporty cut of
yours. Youʼre a beautiful
woman, and itʼs difficult
for beautiful women to
disappear.”
“Unfortunately, I think
youʼre right,” I say. “I just
donʼt want you to think
Iʼm taking advantage. I

just didnʼt know where
else to—”
The waitress, a plain
brunette disguised as a
pretty brunette, drops by,
sets our drinks on the
table. I turn my face from
her and see that the
mustached curious guy is
standing a little closer,
watching me with a half
smile. I am off my game.
Old Amy never would

have come here. My mind
is addled by Diet Coke and
my own body odor.
“I ordered you a gin
and tonic,” I say.
Desi gives a delicate
grimace.
“What?” I ask, but I
already know.
“Thatʼs
my
spring
drink. Iʼm Jack and
gingers now.”
“Then weʼll get you one

of those, and Iʼll have your
gin.”
“No, itʼs fine, donʼt
worry.”
The lookiloo appears
again in my peripheral. “Is
that guy, that guy with the
mustache—donʼt look now
—is he staring at me?”
Desi gives a flick of a
glance, shakes his head.
“Heʼs
watching
the … singers.” He says the

word
dubiously.
“You
donʼt just want a little bit
of cash. Youʼll get tired of
this subterfuge. Not being
able to look people in the
face. Living among”—he
spreads his arms out to
include the whole casino
—“people with whom I
assume you donʼt have
much in common. Living
below your means.”
“Thatʼs what it is for

the next ten years. Until
Iʼve aged enough and the
story has gone away and I
can feel comfortable.”
“Ha! Youʼre willing to
do that for ten years?
Amy?”
“Shhh, donʼt say the
name.”
“Cathy or Jenny or
Megan or whatever, donʼt
be ludicrous.”
The waitress returns,

and Desi hands her a
twenty and dismisses her.
She walks away grinning.
Holding the twenty up like
it is novel. I take a sip of
my drink. The baby wonʼt
mind.
“I donʼt think Nick
would press charges if you
return,” Desi says.
“What?”
“He came by to see me.
I think he knows that heʼs

to blame—”
“He went to see you?
When?”
“Last week. Before Iʼd
talked to you, thank God.”
Nick has shown more
interest in me these past
ten days than he has in the
past few years. Iʼve always
wanted a man to get in a
fight over me—a brutal,
bloody fight. Nick going to
interrogate Desi, thatʼs a

nice start.
“What did he say?” I
ask. “How did he seem?”
“He seemed like a topdrawer asshole. He wanted
to pin it on me. Told me
some insane story about
how I—”
Iʼd always liked that lie
about Desi trying to kill
himself over me. He had
truly been devastated by
our breakup, and heʼd

been
really
annoying,
creepy, hanging around
campus, hoping Iʼd take
him back. So he might as
well
have
attempted
suicide.
“What did Nick say
about me?”
“I think he knows that
he can never hurt you now
that the world knows and
cares about who you are.
Heʼd have to let you come

back safely, and you could
divorce him and marry the
right man.” He took a sip.
“At long last.”
“I canʼt come back,
Desi. Even if people
believed everything about
Nickʼs abuse. Iʼd still be
the one they hated—I was
the one who tricked them.
Iʼd be the biggest pariah in
the world.”
“Youʼd be my pariah,

and Iʼd love you no matter
what, and Iʼd shield you
from everything,” Desi
said. “You would never
have to deal with any of
it.”
“Weʼd never be able to
socialize
with
anyone
again.”
“We could leave the
country if you want. Live
in Spain, Italy, wherever
you like, spend our days

eating mangoes in the sun.
Sleep late, play Scrabble,
flip
through
books
aimlessly, swim in the
ocean.”
“And when I died, Iʼd
be some bizarre footnote—
a freak show. No. I do
have pride, Desi.”
“Iʼm not letting you go
back to the trailer-park
life. Iʼm not. Come with
me, weʼll set you up in the

lake house. Itʼs very
secluded.
Iʼll
bring
groceries and anything you
need, anytime. You can
hide out, all alone, until
we decide what to do.”
Desiʼs lake house was a
mansion,
and
bringing
groceries was becoming my
lover. I could feel the need
coming off him like heat.
He was squirming a little
under his suit, wanting to

make it happen. Desi was
a collector: He had four
cars, three houses, suites
of suits and shoes. He
would like knowing I was
stowed away under glass.
The ultimate white-knight
fantasy: He steals the
abused princess from her
squalid circumstances and
places her under his gilded
protection in a castle that
no one can breach but

him.
“I canʼt do that. What if
the
police
find
out
somehow and they come
to search?”
“Amy, the police think
youʼre dead.”
“No, I should be on my
own for now. Can I just
have a little cash from
you?”
“What if I say no?”
“Then Iʼll know your

offer to help me isnʼt
genuine. That youʼre like
Nick and you just want
control over me, however
you can get it.”
Desi
was
silent,
swallowing his drink with
a tight jaw. “Thatʼs a
rather monstrous thing to
say.”
“Itʼs a rather monstrous
way to act.”
“Iʼm not acting that

way,”
he
said.
“Iʼm
worried about you. Try the
lake house. If you feel
cramped by me, if you feel
uncomfortable, you leave.
The worst that can happen
is you get a few daysʼ rest
and relaxation.”
The mustached guy is
suddenly at our table, a
flickering smile on his
face. “Maʼam, I donʼt
suppose
youʼre
any

relation to the Enloe
family, are you?” he asks.
“No,” I say, and turn
away.
“Sorry, you just look
like some—”
“Weʼre from Canada,
now excuse us,” Desi
snaps, and the guy rolls his
eyes, mutters a jeez, and
strolls back to the bar. But
he keeps glancing at me.
“We should leave,” Desi

says. “Come to the lake
house. Iʼll take you there
now.” He stands.
Desiʼs
lake
house
would have a grand
kitchen, it would have
rooms I could traipse
around in—I could “hills
are alive” twirl in them,
the rooms would be so
massive. The house would
have Wi-Fi and cable—for
all my command-center

needs—and
a
gaping
bathtub and plush robes
and a bed that didnʼt
threaten to collapse.
It would have Desi too,
but
Desi
could
be
managed.
At the bar, the guy is
still staring at me, less
benevolently.
I lean over and kiss
Desi gently on the lips. It
has to seem like my

decision. “Youʼre such a
wonderful man. Iʼm sorry
to put you in this
situation.”
“I want to be in this
situation, Amy.”
We are on our way out,
walking past a particularly
depressing
bar,
TVs
buzzing in all corners,
when I see the Slut.
The Slut is holding a
press conference.

Andie looks tiny and
harmless. She looks like a
babysitter, and not a sexy
porn babysitter but the girl
from down the road, the
one who actually plays
with the kids. I know this
is not the real Andie,
because I have followed
her in real life. In real life
she wears snug tops that
show off her breasts, and
clingy jeans, and her hair

long and wavy. In real life
she looks fuckable.
Now she is wearing a
ruffled shirtdress with her
hair tucked behind her
ears, and she looks like
sheʼs been crying, you can
tell by the small pink pads
beneath her eyes. She
looks
exhausted
and
nervous but very pretty.
Prettier than Iʼd thought
before. I never saw her this

close up. She has freckles.
“Ohhhh, shit,” says one
woman to her friend, a
cheap-cabernet redhead.
“Oh noooo, I was
actually starting to feel
bad for the guy,” says the
friend.
“I have crap in my
fridge older than that girl.
What an asshole.”
Andie stands behind
the mike and looks down

with dark eyelashes at a
statement that leaf-shakes
in her hand. Her upper lip
is damp; it shines under
the camera lights. She
swipes an index finger to
blot the sweat. “Um. My
statement is this: I did
engage in an affair with
Nick Dunne from April
2011 until July of this
year, when his wife, Amy
Dunne, went missing. Nick

was my professor at North
Carthage Junior College,
and we became friendly,
and then the relationship
became more.”
Andie stops to clear her
throat.
A
dark-haired
woman behind her, not
much older than I am,
hands her a glass of water,
which she slurps quickly,
the glass shaking.
“I am deeply ashamed

of having been involved
with a married man. It
goes against all my values.
I truly believed I was in
love”—she begins crying;
her voice shivers—“with
Nick Dunne and that he
was in love with me. He
told
me
that
his
relationship with his wife
was over and that they
would be divorcing soon. I
did not know that Amy

Dunne was pregnant. I am
cooperating
with
the
police
in
their
investigation
in
the
disappearance of Amy
Dunne, and I will do
everything in my power to
help.”
Her voice is tiny,
childish. She looks up at
the wall of cameras in
front of her and seems
shocked, looks back down.

Two apples turn red on her
round cheeks.
“I … I.” She begins
sobbing, and her mother—
that woman has to be her
mother, they have the
same oversize anime eyes
—puts an arm on her
shoulder. Andie continues
reading. “I am so sorry and
ashamed for what I have
done. And I want to
apologize to Amyʼs family

for any role I played in
their
pain.
I
am
cooperating
with
the
police in their investi—
Oh, I said that already.”
She smiles a weak,
embarrassed smile, and the
press
corps
chuckle
encouragingly.
“Poor little thing,” says
the redhead.
She is a little slut, she is
not to be pitied. I cannot

believe anyone would feel
sorry for Andie. I literally
refuse to believe it.
“I am a twenty-threeyear-old
student,”
she
continues. “I ask only for
some privacy to heal
during this very painful
time.”
“Good luck with that,” I
mutter as Andie backs
away and a police officer
declines to take any

questions and they walk
off camera. I catch myself
leaning to the left as if I
could follow them.
“Poor little lamb,” says
the older woman. “She
seemed terrified.”
“I guess he did do it
after all.”
“Over a year he was
with her.”
“Slimebag.”
Desi gives me a nudge

and widens his eyes in a
question: Did I know about
the affair? Was I okay? My
face is a mask of fury—
poor little lamb, my ass—
but I can pretend it is
because of this betrayal. I
nod, smile weakly. I am
okay. We are about to
leave when I see my
parents, holding hands as
always, stepping up to the
mike in tandem. My

mother looks like sheʼs just
gotten her hair cut. I
wonder if I should be
annoyed that she paused
in the middle of my
disappearance for personal
grooming. When someone
dies and the relatives carry
on, you always hear them
say so-and-so would have
wanted it that way. I donʼt
want it that way.
My mother speaks.

“Our statement is brief,
and we will take no
questions afterward. First,
thank
you
for
the
tremendous outpouring for
our family. It seems the
world loves Amy as much
as we do. Amy: We miss
your warm voice and your
good humor, and your
quick wit and your good
heart. You are indeed
amazing. We will return

you to our family. I know
we will. Second, we did
not know that our son-inlaw, Nick Dunne, was
having an affair until this
morning. He has been,
since the beginning of this
nightmare, less involved,
less
interested,
less
concerned than he should
be. Giving him the benefit
of the doubt, we attributed
this behavior to shock.

With our new knowledge,
we no longer feel this way.
We have withdrawn our
support
from
Nick
accordingly. As we move
forward
with
the
investigation, we can only
hope that Amy comes back
to us. Her story must
continue. The world is
ready for a new chapter.”
Amen, says someone.

NICK DUNNE
TEN DAYS GONE

The show was over,
Andie and the Elliotts gone
from
view.
Sharonʼs
producer kicked the TV off
with the point of her heel.
Everyone in the room was
watching me, waiting for

an explanation, the party
guest who just shat on the
floor. Sharon gave me a
too-bright smile, an angry
smile that strained her
Botox. Her face folded in
the wrong spots.
“Well?” she said in her
calm,
plummy
voice.
“What the fuck was that?”
Tanner stepped in.
“That was the bombshell.
Nick was and is fully

prepared to disclose and
discuss his actions. Iʼm
sorry about the timing, but
in a way, itʼs better for
you, Sharon. Youʼll get the
first react from Nick.”
“Youʼd better have
some goddamn interesting
things to say, Nick.” She
breezed away, calling,
“Mike him, we do this
now,” to no one in
particular.

Sharon Schieber, it
turned out, fucking adored
me. In New York Iʼd
always heard rumors that
sheʼd been a cheat herself
and returned to her
husband, a very hush-hush
inside-journalism
story.
That was almost ten years
ago, but I figured the urge
to absolve might still be
there. It was. She beamed,
she coddled, she cajoled

and teased. She pursed
those full, glossy lips at me
in
deep
sincerity—a
knuckled hand under her
chin—and asked me her
hard questions, and for
once I answered them
well. I am not a liar of
Amyʼs dazzling caliber, but
Iʼm not bad when I have to
be. I looked like a man
who loved his wife, who
was
shamed
by
his

infidelities and ready to do
right. The night before,
sleepless and nervy, Iʼd
gone online and watched
Hugh Grant on Leno,
1995, apologizing to the
nation for getting lewd
with a hooker. Stuttering,
stammering, squirming as
if his skin were two sizes
too small. But no excuses:
“I think you know in life
whatʼs a good thing to do

and whatʼs a bad thing,
and
I
did
a
bad
thing … and there you
have it.” Damn, the guy
was
good—he
looked
sheepish,
nervous,
so
shaky you wanted to take
his hand and say, Buddy,
itʼs not that big a deal, donʼt
beat yourself up. Which was
the effect I was going for. I
watched that clip so many
times, I was in danger of

borrowing a British accent.
I was the ultimate
hollow man: the husband
that Amy always claimed
couldnʼt apologize finally
did, using words and
emotions borrowed from
an actor.
But it worked. Sharon, I
did a bad thing, an
unforgivable thing. I canʼt
make any excuses for it. I let
myself down—Iʼve never

thought of myself as a
cheater. Itʼs inexcusable, itʼs
unforgivable, and I just want
Amy to come home so I can
spend the rest of my life
making it up to her, treating
her how she deserves.
Oh, Iʼd definitely like
to treat her how she
deserves.
But hereʼs the thing,
Sharon: I did not kill Amy. I
would never hurt her. I think

whatʼs happening here is
what Iʼve been calling [a
chuckle] in my mind the
Ellen Abbott effect. This
embarrassing, irresponsible
brand of journalism. We are
so used to seeing these
murders of women packaged
as entertainment, which is
disgusting, and in these
shows, who is guilty? Itʼs
always the husband. So I
think the public and, to an

extent, even the police have
been
hammered
into
believing thatʼs always the
case. From the beginning, it
was practically assumed I
had killed my wife—because
thatʼs the story we are told
time after time—and thatʼs
wrong, thatʼs morally wrong.
I did not kill my wife. I want
her to come home.
I knew Sharon would
like an opportunity to

paint Ellen Abbott as a
sensationalistic
ratings
whore. I knew regal
Sharon with her twenty
years in journalism, her
interviews with Arafat and
Sarkozy
and
Obama,
would be offended by the
very idea of Ellen Abbott. I
am (was) a journalist, I
know the drill, and so
when I said those words
—the Ellen Abbott effect—I

recognized Sharonʼs mouth
twitch,
the
delicately
raised
eyebrows,
the
lightening of her whole
visage. It was the look
when you realize: I got my
angle.
At the end of the
interview, Sharon took
both my hands in hers—
cool, a bit calloused, Iʼd
read she was an avid
golfer—and wished me

well. “I will be keeping a
close eye on you, my
friend,” she said, and then
she was kissing Go on the
cheek and swishing away
from us, the back of her
dress a battlefield of
stickpins to keep the
material in front from
slouching.
“You fucking did that
perfectly,” Go pronounced
as she headed to the door.

“You seem totally different
than before. In charge but
not cocky. Even your jaw
is less … dickish.”
“I unclefted my chin.”
“Almost, yeah. See you
back home.” She actually
gave me a go-champ
punch to the shoulder.
I followed the Sharon
Schieber interview with
two quickies—one cable
and
one
network.

Tomorrow the Schieber
interview would air, and
then the others would roll
out,
a
domino
of
apologetics and remorse. I
was taking control. I was
no longer going to settle
for being the possibly
guilty husband or the
emotionally
removed
husband or the heartlessly
cheating husband. I was
the guy everyone knew—

the guy many men (and
women) have been: I
cheated, I feel like shit, I will
do what needs to be done to
fix the situation because I
am a real man.
“We are in decent
shape,”
Tanner
pronounced
as
we
wrapped up.
“The thing with Andie,
it wonʼt be as awful as it
might have been, thanks to

the interview with Sharon.
We just need to stay ahead
of everything else from
now on.”
Go phoned, and I
picked up. Her voice was
thin and high.
“The cops are here with
a
warrant
for
the
woodshed … theyʼre at
Dadʼs
house
too.
Theyʼre … Iʼm scared.”
Go was in the kitchen

smoking a cigarette when
we arrived, and judging
from the overflow in the
kitschy ʼ70s ashtray, she
was on her second pack.
An awkward, shoulderless
kid with a crew cut and a
police officerʼs uniform sat
next to her on one of the
bar stools.
“This is Tyler,” she
said. “He grew up in
Tennessee, he has a horse

named Custard—”
“Custer,” Tyler said.
“Custer,
and
heʼs
allergic to peanuts. Not the
horse but Tyler. Oh, and
he has a torn labrum,
which is the same injury
baseball pitchers get, but
heʼs not sure how he got
it.” She took a drag on the
cigarette.
Her
eyes
watered. “Heʼs been here a
long time.”

Tyler tried to give me a
tough look, ended up
watching his well-shined
shoes.
Boney
appeared
through the sliding glass
doors at the back of the
house. “Big day, boys,” she
said. “Wish youʼd bothered
letting us know, Nick, that
you have a girlfriend.
Would have saved us all a
lot of time.”

“Weʼre happy to discuss
that, as well as the
contents of the shed, both
of which we were on our
way to tell you about,”
Tanner said. “Frankly, if
you had given us the
courtesy of telling us about
Andie, a lot of pain could
have been forestalled. But
you needed the press
conference, you had to
have the publicity. How

disgusting, to put that girl
up there like that.”
“Right,” Boney said.
“So, the woodshed. You all
want to come with me?”
She turned her back on us,
leading the way over the
patchy
end-of-summer
grass to the woodshed. A
cobweb trailed from her
hair like a wedding veil.
She motioned impatiently
when she saw me not

following. “Come on,” she
said. “Not gonna bite you.”
The woodshed was lit
up by several portable
lights, making it look even
more ominous.
“Whenʼs the last time
you been in here, Nick?”
“I came in here very
recently, when my wifeʼs
treasure hunt led me here.
But itʼs not my stuff, and I
did not touch anything—”

Tanner cut me off: “My
client and I have an
explosive new theory—”
Tanner began, then caught
himself. The phony TVspeak was so incredibly
awful and inappropriate,
we all cringed.
“Oh, explosive, how
exciting,” Boney said.
“We were about to
inform you—”
“Really?
What

convenient timing,” she
said. “Stay there, please.”
The door hung loose on its
hinges, a broken lock
dangling to the side. Gilpin
was inside, cataloging the
goods.
“These the golf clubs
you donʼt play with?”
Gilpin said, jostling the
glinting irons.
“None of this is mine—
none of this was put there

by me.”
“Thatʼs funny, because
everything
in
here
corresponds
with
purchases made on the
credit cards that arenʼt
yours
either,”
Boney
snapped. “This is, like,
what do they call it, a man
cave? A man cave in the
making, just waiting for
the wife to go away for
good. Got yourself some

nice pastimes, Nick.” She
pulled out three large
cardboard boxes and set
them at my feet.
“Whatʼs this?”
Boney opened them
with
fingertip
disgust
despite her gloved hands.
Inside were dozens of porn
DVDs, flesh of all color
and size on display on the
covers.
Gilpin chuckled. “I

gotta hand it to you, Nick,
I mean, a man has his
needs—”
“Men are highly visual,
thatʼs what my ex always
said when I caught him,”
Boney said.
“Men are highly visual,
but Nick, this shit made
me blush,” Gilpin said. “It
made me a little sick too,
some of it, and I donʼt get
sick too easy.” He spread

out a few of the DVDs like
an ugly deck of cards.
Most of the titles implied
violence:
Brutal
Anal,
Brutal Blowjobs, Humiliated
Whores,
Sadistic
Slut
Fucking, Gang-raped Sluts,
and a series called Hurt the
Bitch, volumes 1–18, each
featuring photos of women
writhing in pain while
leering, laughing men
inserted objects into them.

I turned away.
“Oh,
now
heʼs
embarrassed.”
Gilpin
grinned.
But I didnʼt respond
because I saw Go being
helped into the back of a
police car.
We met an hour later at
the police station. Tanner
advised
against
it—I
insisted. I appealed to his
iconoclast,
millionaire

rodeo-cowboy ego. We
were going to tell the cops
the truth. It was time.
I could handle them
fucking with me—but not
my sister.
“Iʼm agreeing to this
because I think your arrest
is inevitable, Nick, no
matter what we do,” he
said. “If we let them know
weʼre up for talking, we
may get some more

information on the case
theyʼve got against you.
Without a body, theyʼll
really want a confession,
so theyʼll try to overwhelm
you with the evidence.
And that may give us
enough to really jumpstart
our defense.”
“And we give them
everything, right?” I said.
“We give them the clues
and the marionettes and

Amy.” I was panicked,
aching to go—I could
picture the cops right now
sweating my sister under a
bare lightbulb.
“As long as you let me
talk,” Tanner said. “If itʼs
me talking about the
frame-up, they canʼt use it
against us at trial … if we
go
with
a
different
defense.”
It concerned me that

my lawyer found the truth
to be so completely
unbelievable.
Gilpin met us at the
steps of the station, a Coke
in his hand, late dinner.
When he turned around to
lead us in, I saw a sweatsoaked back. The sun had
long set, but the humidity
remained. He flapped his
arms once, and the shirt
fluttered and stuck right

back to his skin.
“Still hot,” he said.
“Supposed to get hotter
overnight.”
Boney was waiting for
us in the conference room,
the one from the first
night. The Night Of. Sheʼd
French-braided her limp
hair and clipped it to the
back of her head in a
rather poignant updo, and
she
wore
lipstick.
I

wondered if she had a
date. A meet you after
midnight situation.
“You have kids?” I
asked her, pulling out a
chair.
She looked startled and
held up a finger. “One.”
She didnʼt say a name or
an age or anything else.
Boney was in business
mode. She tried to wait us
out.

“You first,” Tanner
said. “Tell us what you
got.”
“Sure,” Boney said.
“Okay.” She turned on the
tape recorder, dispensed
with the preliminaries. “It
is your contention, Nick,
that you never bought or
touched the items in the
woodshed on your sisterʼs
property.”
“That
is
correct,”

Tanner replied for me.
“Nick, your fingerprints
are all over almost every
item in the shed.”
“Thatʼs a lie! I touched
nothing, not a thing in
there! Except for my
anniversary present, which
Amy left inside.”
Tanner touched my
arm: Shut the fuck up.
“Nick, your fingerprints
are on the porn, on the

golf clubs, on the watch
cases, and even on the
TV.”
And then I saw it, how
much Amy would have
enjoyed this: my deep,
self-satisfied sleep (which I
lorded over her, my belief
that if she were only more
laid-back, more like me,
her
insomnia
would
vanish) turned against me.
I could see it: Amy down

on her knees, my snores
heating her cheeks, as she
pressed a fingertip here
and there over the course
of months. She could have
slipped me a mickey for all
I knew. I remember her
peering at me one morning
as I woke up, sleep-wax
gumming my lips, and she
said, “You sleep the sleep
of the damned, you know.
Or the drugged.” I was

both and didnʼt know it.
“Do you want to
explain
about
the
fingerprints?” Gilpin said.
“Tell us the rest,”
Tanner said.
Boney set a biblically
thick
leather-covered
binder on the table
between us, charred all
along
the
edges.
“Recognize this?”
I shrugged, shook my

head.
“Itʼs your wifeʼs diary.”
“Um, no. Amy didnʼt
do diaries.”
“Actually, Nick, she
did. She did about seven
yearsʼ worth,” Boney said.
“Okay.”
Something bad was
about to happen. My wife
was being clever again.

AMY
ELLIOTT
DUNNE
TEN DAYS GONE

We drive my car across
state lines into Illinois, to a
particularly
awful
neighborhood of some

busted river town, and we
spend an hour wiping it
down, and then we leave it
with the keys in the
ignition. Call it the circle
of strife: The Arkansas
couple who drove it before
me were sketchy; Ozark
Amy was obviously shady;
hopefully, some Illinois
down-and-outer will enjoy
it for a bit too.
Then we drive back

into Missouri over wavy
hills until I can see,
between the trees, Lake
Hannafan
glistening.
Because Desi has family in
St. Louis, he likes to
believe the area is old,
East Coast old, but he is
wrong. Lake Hannafan is
not
named
after
a
nineteenth-century
statesman or a Civil War
hero. It is a private lake,

machine-forged in 2002 by
an oily developer named
Mike
Hannafan
who
turned out to have a
moonlighting job illegally
disposing of hazardous
waste.
The
kerfuffled
community is scrambling
to find a new name for
their lake. Lake Collings,
Iʼm sure, has been floated.
So despite the wellplanned lake—upon which

a few select residents can
sail but not motor—and
Desiʼs tastefully grand
house—a Swiss château on
an
American
scale—I
remain unwooed. That was
always the problem with
Desi. Be from Missouri or
donʼt, but donʼt pretend
Lake “Collings” is Lake
Como.
He leans against his
Jaguar and aims his gaze

up at the house so that I
have
to
pause
for
appreciation also.
“We modeled it after
this wonderful little chalet
my mother and I stayed at
in Brienzersee,” he says.
“All weʼre missing is the
mountain range.”
A rather big miss, I
think, but I put my hand
on his arm and say, “Show
me the inside. It must be

fabulous.”
He gives me the nickel
tour, laughing at the idea
of a nickel. A cathedral
kitchen—all granite and
chrome—a living room
with
his-and-hers
fireplaces that flows onto
an outdoor space (what
midwesterners call a deck)
overlooking the woods and
the lake. A basement
entertainment room with a

snooker
table,
darts,
surround sound, a wet bar,
and its own outdoor space
(what midwesterners call
another deck). A sauna off
the entertainment room
and next to it the wine
cellar.
Upstairs,
five
bedrooms,
the
second
largest of which he
bestows on me.
“I had it repainted,” he
says. “I know you love

dusty rose.”
I donʼt love dusty rose
anymore; that was high
school. “You are so lovely,
Desi, thank you,” I say, my
most heartfelt. My thankyous always come out
rather labored. I often
donʼt give them at all.
People do what theyʼre
supposed to do and then
wait for you to pile on the
appreciation—theyʼre like

frozen-yogurt employees
who put out cups for tips.
But Desi takes to thankyous like a cat being
brushed; his back almost
arches with the pleasure.
For now itʼs a worthwhile
gesture.
I set my bag down in
my room, trying to signal
my retirement for the
evening—I need to see
how people are reacting to

Andieʼs confession and
whether Nick has been
arrested—but it seems I
am far from through with
the thank-yous. Desi has
ensured I will be forever
indebted to him. He smiles
a special-surprise smile
and takes my hand (I have
something else to show you)
and
pulls
me
back
downstairs (I really hope
you like this) onto a

hallway off the kitchen (it
took a lot of work, but itʼs so
worth it).
“I really hope you like
this,” he says again, and
flings open the door.
Itʼs a glass room, a
greenhouse,
I
realize.
Within
are
tulips,
hundreds, of all colors.
Tulips bloom in the middle
of July in Desiʼs lake
house. In their own special

room for a very special
girl.
“I know tulips are your
favorite, but the season is
so short,” Desi said. “So I
fixed that for you. Theyʼll
bloom year-round.”
He puts his arm around
my waist and aims me
toward the flowers so I can
appreciate them fully.
“Tulips any day of the
year,” I say, and try to get

my eyes to glisten. Tulips
were my favorite in high
school.
They
were
everyoneʼs favorite, the
gerbera daisy of the late
ʼ80s. Now I like orchids,
which are basically the
opposite of tulips.
“Would Nick ever have
thought of something like
this
for
you?”
Desi
breathes into my ear as the
tulips sway under a

mechanized dusting of
water from above.
“Nick
never
even
remembered I liked tulips,”
I say, the correct answer.
It is sweet, beyond
sweet, the gesture. My
own flower room, like a
fairy tale. And yet I feel a
lilt of nerves: I called Desi
only twenty-four hours
ago, and these are not
newly planted tulips, and

the bedroom did not smell
of fresh paint. It makes me
wonder: the uptick in his
letters the past year, their
woeful tone … how long
has he been wanting to
bring me here? And how
long does he think I will
stay? Long enough to
enjoy blooming tulips
every day for a year.
“My goodness, Desi,” I
say. “Itʼs like a fairy tale.”

“Your fairy tale,” he
says. “I want you to see
what life can be like.”
In fairy tales, there is
always gold. I wait for him
to give me a stack of bills,
a
slim
credit
card,
something of use. The tour
loops back around through
all the rooms so I can ooh
and ahh about details I
missed the first time, and
then we return to my

bedroom, a satin-and-silk,
pink-and-plush,
marshmallow-and-cottoncandy girlʼs room. As I
peer out a window, I
notice the high wall that
surrounds the house.
I
blurt,
nervously,
“Desi, would you be able
to leave me with some
money?”
He actually pretends to
be surprised. “You donʼt

need money now, do you?”
he says. “You have no rent
to pay anymore; the house
will be stocked with food.
I can bring new clothes for
you. Not that I donʼt like
you in bait-shop chic.”
“I guess a little cash
would just make me feel
more comfortable. Should
something happen. Should
I need to get out of here
quickly.”

He opens his wallet and
pulls out two twenty-dollar
bills. Presses them gently
in my hand. “There you
are,” he says indulgently.
I wonder then if I have
made a very big mistake.

NICK DUNNE
TEN DAYS GONE

I made a mistake,
feeling so cocky. Whatever
the hell this diary was, it
was going to ruin me. I
could already see the cover
of the true-crime novel:
the black-and-white photo

of us on our wedding day,
the blood-red background,
the jacket copy: including
sixteen pages of never-seen
photos and Amy Elliott
Dunneʼs actual diary entries
—a voice from beyond the
grave … Iʼd found it
strange and kind of cute,
Amyʼs guilty pleasures,
those cheesy true-crime
books Iʼd discovered here
and there around our

house. I thought maybe
she was loosening up,
allowing herself some
beach reading.
Nope. She was just
studying.
Gilpin pulled over a
chair, sat on it backward,
and leaned toward me on
crossed arms—his moviecop look. It was almost
midnight; it felt later.
“Tell us about your

wifeʼs illness these past
few months,” he said.
“Illness? Amy never got
sick. Once a year sheʼd get
a cold, maybe.”
Boney picked up the
book, turned to a marked
page. “Last month you
made Amy and yourself
some drinks, sat on your
back porch. She writes
here that the drinks were
impossibly
sweet
and

describes what she thinks
is an allergic reaction: My
heart was racing, my tongue
was slabbed, stuck to the
bottom of my mouth. My
legs turned to meat as Nick
walked me up the stairs.”
She put a finger down to
hold her place in the diary,
looked up as if I might not
be
paying
attention.
“When she woke the next
morning: My head ached

and my stomach was oily,
but weirder, my fingernails
were light blue, and when I
looked in the mirror, so were
my lips. I didnʼt pee for two
days after. I felt so weak.”
I shook my head in
disgust.
Iʼd
become
attached to Boney; I
expected better of her.
“Is this your wifeʼs
handwriting?” Boney tilted
the book toward me, and I

saw deep black ink and
Amyʼs cursive, jagged as a
fever chart.
“Yes, I think so.”
“So
does
our
handwriting expert.”
Boney said the words
with a certain pride, and I
realized: This was the first
case these two had ever
had that required outside
experts, that demanded
they get in touch with

professionals
who
did
exotic things like analyze
handwriting.
“You know what else
we learned, Nick, when we
showed this entry to our
medical expert?”
“Poisoning,” I blurted.
Tanner frowned at me:
steady.
Boney stuttered for a
second; this was not
information
I
was

supposed to provide.
“Yeah, Nick, thank you:
antifreeze poisoning,” she
said. “Textbook. Sheʼs
lucky she survived.”
“She didnʼt survive,
because
that
never
happened,” I said. “Like
you said, itʼs textbook—
itʼs made up from an
Internet search.”
Boney frowned but
refused to bite. “The diary

isnʼt a pretty picture of
you, Nick,” she continued,
one finger tracing her
braid. “Abuse—you pushed
her around. Stress—you
were quick to anger.
Sexual
relations
that
bordered on rape. She was
very frightened of you at
the end there. Itʼs painful
to read. That gun we were
wondering about, she says
she wanted it because she

was afraid of you. Hereʼs
her last entry: This man
might kill me. This man
might kill me, in her own
words.”
My throat clenched. I
felt like I might throw up.
Fear, mostly, and then a
surge of rage. Fucking
bitch, fucking bitch, cunt,
cunt, cunt.
“What
a
smart,
convenient note for her to

end on,” I said. Tanner put
a hand on mine to hush
me.
“You look like you
want to kill her again,
right now,” Boney said.
“Youʼve done nothing
but lie to us, Nick,” Gilpin
said. “You say you were at
the beach that morning.
Everyone we talk to says
you hate the beach. You
say you have no idea what

all these purchases are on
your maxed-out credit
cards. Now we have a shed
full of exactly those items,
and
they
have
your
fingerprints all over them.
We have a wife suffering
from what sounds like
antifreeze poisoning weeks
before she disappears. I
mean, come on.” He
paused for effect.
“Anything
else
of

note?” Tanner asked.
“We can place you in
Hannibal, where your
wifeʼs purse shows up a
few days later,” Boney
said. “We have a neighbor
who overheard you two
arguing the night before. A
pregnancy
you
didnʼt
want. A bar borrowed on
your wifeʼs money that
would revert to her in case
of a divorce. And of

course, of course: a secret
girlfriend of more than a
year.”
“We can help you right
now, Nick,” Gilpin said.
“Once we arrest you, we
canʼt.”
“Where did you find
the diary? At Nickʼs
fatherʼs house?” Tanner
asked.
“Yes,” Boney said.
Tanner nodded to me:

Thatʼs what we didnʼt find.
“Let me guess: anonymous
tip.”
Neither cop said a
thing.
“Can I ask where in the
house you found it?” I
asked.
“In the furnace. I know
you thought you burned it.
It caught fire, but the pilot
light was too weak; it got
smothered. So only the

outer
edges
burned,”
Gilpin said. “Extremely
good luck for us.”
The furnace—another
inside joke from Amy!
Sheʼd always proclaimed
amazement at how little I
understood the things men
are
supposed
to
understand. During our
search, Iʼd even glanced at
my dadʼs old furnace, with
its pipes and wires and

spigots, and backed away,
intimidated.
“It wasnʼt luck. You
were meant to find it,” I
said.
Boney let the left side
of her mouth slide into a
smile. She leaned back and
waited, relaxed as the star
of an iced-tea commercial.
I gave Tanner an angry
nod: Go ahead.
“Amy Elliott Dunne is

alive, and she is framing
Nick Dunne for her
murder,” he said. I clasped
my hands and sat up
straight, tried to do
anything that would lend
me an air of reason. Boney
stared at me. I needed a
pipe, eyeglasses I could
swiftly remove for effect, a
set of encyclopedias at my
elbow. I felt giddy. Do not
laugh.

Boney
frowned.
“Whatʼs that again?”
“Amy is alive and very
well, and she is framing
Nick,” my proxy repeated.
They exchanged a look,
hunched over the table:
Can you believe this guy?
“Why would she do
that?”
Gilpin
asked,
rubbing his eyes.
“Because she hates him.
Obviously. He was a shitty

husband.”
Boney looked down at
the floor, let out a breath.
“Iʼd certainly agree with
you there.”
At the same time,
Gilpin said: “Oh, for
Christʼs sake.”
“Is she crazy, Nick?”
Boney said, leaning in.
“What
youʼre
talking
about, itʼs crazy. You hear
me? It would have taken,

what, six months, a year,
to set all this up. She
would have had to hate
you, to wish you harm—
ultimate, serious, horrific
harm—for a year. Do you
know how hard it is to
sustain that kind of hatred
for that long?”
She could do it. Amy
could do it.
“Why not just divorce
your ass?” Boney snapped.

“That wouldnʼt appeal
to her … sense of justice,”
I replied. Tanner gave me
another look.
“Jesus Christ, Nick,
arenʼt you tired of all
this?” Gilpin said. “We
have it in your wifeʼs own
words: I think he may kill
me.”
Someone had told them
at some point: Use the
suspectʼs name a lot, it

will
make
him
feel
comfortable, known. Same
idea as in sales.
“You been in your
dadʼs house lately, Nick?”
Boney asked. “Like on July
ninth?”
Fuck. Thatʼs why Amy
changed the alarm code. I
battled a new wave of
disgust at myself: that my
wife played me twice. Not
only did she dupe me into

believing she still loved
me, she actually forced me
to implicate myself. Wicked,
wicked girl. I almost
laughed. Good Lord, I
hated her, but you had to
admire the bitch.
Tanner began: “Amy
used her clues to force my
client to go to these
various venues, where
sheʼd
left
evidence—
Hannibal,
his
fatherʼs

house—so
heʼd
incriminate himself. My
client and I have brought
these clues with us. As a
courtesy.”
He pulled out the clues
and the love notes, fanned
them in front of the cops
like a card trick. I sweated
while they read them,
willing them to look up
and tell me all was clear
now.

“Okay. You say Amy
hated you so much that
she spent months framing
you for her murder?”
Boney asked in the quiet,
measured voice of a
disappointed parent.
I gave her a blank face.
“This does not sound
like an angry woman,
Nick,” she said.
“Sheʼs falling all over
herself to apologize to you,

to suggest that you both
start again, to let you
know how much she loves
you: You are warm—you
are my sun. You are
brilliant, you are witty.”
“Oh, for fuckʼs sake.”
“Once again, Nick, an
incredibly strange reaction
for an innocent man,”
Boney said. “Here we are,
reading
sweet
words,
maybe your wifeʼs last

words to you, and you
actually look angry. I still
remember that very first
night: Amyʼs missing, you
come in here, we park you
in this very room for fortyfive minutes, and you look
bored. We watched you on
surveillance,
you
practically fell asleep.”
“That has nothing to do
with anything—” Tanner
started.

“I was trying to stay
calm.”
“You looked very, very
calm,” Boney said. “All
along,
youʼve
acted … inappropriately.
Unemotional, flippant.”
“Thatʼs just how I am,
donʼt you see? Iʼm stoic.
To a fault. Amy knows
this … She complained
about it all the time. That I
wasnʼt
sympathetic

enough, that I retreated
into myself, that I couldnʼt
handle difficult emotions
—sadness, guilt. She knew
Iʼd look suspicious as hell.
Jesus fucking Christ! Talk
to Hilary Handy, will you?
Talk to Tommy OʼHara. I
talked to them! Theyʼll tell
you what sheʼs like.”
“We have talked to
them,” Gilpin said.
“And?”

“Hilary
Handy
has
made two suicide attempts
in the years since high
school. Tommy OʼHara has
been in rehab twice.”
“Probably because of
Amy.”
“Or because theyʼre
deeply unstable, guiltridden human beings,”
Boney said. “Letʼs go back
to the treasure hunt.”
Gilpin read aloud Clue

2
in
a
deliberate
monotone.
You took me here
so I could hear you chat
About your
boyhood
adventures:
crummy jeans and visor
hat
Screw everyone
else, for us theyʼre all
ditched
And letʼs sneak a
kiss … pretend we just

got hitched.
“You say this was
written to force you to go
to Hannibal?” Boney said.
I nodded.
“It
doesnʼt
say
Hannibal anywhere here,”
she said. “It doesnʼt even
imply it.”
“The visor hat, thatʼs
an old inside joke between
us about—”
“Oh, an inside joke,”

Gilpin said.
“What about the next
clue, the little brown
house?” Boney asked.
“To go to my dadʼs,” I
said.
Boneyʼs face grew stern
again. “Nick, your dadʼs
house is blue.” She turned
to Tanner with rolling
eyes: This is what youʼre
giving me?
“It sounds to me like

youʼre making up ʻinside
jokesʼ in these clues,”
Boney said. “I mean, you
want
to
talk
about
convenient: We find out
youʼve been to Hannibal,
whaddaya know, this clue
secretly means go to
Hannibal.”
“The
final
present
here,” Tanner said, pulling
the box onto the table, “is
a not-so-subtle hint. Punch

and Judy dolls. As you
know, Iʼm sure, Punch kills
Judy and her baby. This
was discovered by my
client. We wanted to make
sure you have it.”
Boney pulled the box
over, put on latex gloves,
and lifted the puppets out.
“Heavy,” she said, “solid.”
She examined the lace of
the womanʼs dress, the
maleʼs motley. She picked

up the male, examined the
thick wooden handle with
the finger grooves.
She froze, frowning,
the male puppet in her
hands. Then she turned the
female upside down so the
skirt flew up.
“No handle for this
one.” She turned to me.
“Did there used to be a
handle?”
“How should I know?”

“A handle like a twoby-four, very thick and
heavy,
with
built-in
grooves to get a really
good grip?” she snapped.
“A handle like a goddamn
club?”
She stared at me and I
could tell what she was
thinking: You
are
a
gameplayer. You are a
sociopath. You are a killer.

AMY ELLIOTT
DUNNE
ELEVEN DAYS
GONE

Tonight is Nickʼs much
touted
interview
with
Sharon Schieber. I was
going to watch with a

bottle of good wine after a
hot bath, recording at the
same time, so I can take
notes on his lies. I want to
write
down
every
exaggeration, half truth,
fib, and bald-facer he
utters, so I can gird my
fury against him. It slipped
after the blog interview—
one
drunken,
random
interview!—and I canʼt
allow that to happen. Iʼm

not going to soften. Iʼm
not a chump. Still, I am
eager to hear his thoughts
on Andie now that she has
broken. His spin.
I want to watch alone,
but Desi hovers around me
all day, floating in and out
of whatever room I retreat
to, like a sudden patch of
bad weather, unavoidable.
I canʼt tell him to leave,
because itʼs his house. Iʼve

tried this already, and it
doesnʼt work. Heʼll say he
wants
to
check
the
basement plumbing or he
wants to peer into the
fridge to see what food
items need purchasing.
This will go on, I think.
This is how my life will be.
He will show up when he
wants and stay as long as he
wants, heʼll shamble around
making conversation, and

then heʼll sit, and beckon me
to sit, and heʼll open a bottle
of wine and weʼll suddenly
be sharing a meal and
thereʼs no way to stop it.
“I really am exhausted,”
I say.
“Indulge
your
benefactor a little bit
longer,” he responds, and
runs a finger down the
crease of his pant legs.
He knows about Nickʼs

interview tonight, so he
leaves and returns with all
my
favorite
foods:
Manchego cheese and
chocolate truffles and a
bottle of cold Sancerre
and, with a wry eyebrow,
he even produces the chilicheese Fritos I got hooked
on back when I was Ozark
Amy. He pours the wine.
We have an unspoken
agreement not to get into

details about the baby, we
both
know
how
miscarriages run in my
family, how awful it would
be for me to have to speak
of it.
“Iʼll be interested to
hear what the swine has to
say for himself,” he says.
Desi rarely says jackfuck or
shitbag; he says swine,
which
sounds
more
poisonous on his lips.

An hour later, we have
eaten a light dinner that
Desi cooked, and sipped
the
wine
that
Desi
brought. He has given me
one bite of cheese and split
a truffle with me. He has
given me exactly ten Fritos
and then secreted away
the bag. He doesnʼt like
the smell; it offends him,
he says, but what he really
doesnʼt like is my weight.

Now we are side by side
on the sofa, a spun-soft
blanket over us, because
Desi has cranked up the
air-conditioning so that it
is autumn in July. I think
he has done it so he can
crackle a fire and force us
together
under
the
blanket; he seems to have
an October vision of the
two of us. He even brought
me a gift—a heathery

violet turtleneck sweater
to wear—and I notice it
complements both the
blanket and Desiʼs deep
green sweater.
“You know, all through
the centuries, pathetic men
have abused strong women
who
threaten
their
masculinity,”
Desi
is
saying. “They have such
fragile psyches, they need
that control …”

I am thinking of a
different kind of control. I
am thinking about control
in the guise of caring: Here
is a sweater for the cold, my
sweet, now wear it and
match my vision.
Nick, at least, didnʼt do
this. Nick let me do what I
wanted.
I just want Desi to sit
still and be quiet. Heʼs
fidgety and nervous, as if

his rival is in the room
with us.
“Shhh,” I say as my
pretty face comes on the
screen, then another photo
and another, like falling
leaves, an Amy collage.
“She was the girl that
every girl wanted to be,”
said Sharonʼs voiceover.
“Beautiful,
brilliant,
inspiring,
and
very
wealthy.”

“He was the guy that
all men admired …”
“Not this man,” Desi
muttered.
“… handsome, funny,
bright, and charming.”
“But on July fifth, their
seemingly perfect world
came crashing in when
Amy
Elliott
Dunne
disappeared on their fifth
wedding anniversary.”
Recap recap recap.

Photos of me, Andie, Nick.
Stock
photos
of
a
pregnancy test and unpaid
bills. I really did do a nice
job. Itʼs like painting a
mural and stepping back
and thinking: Perfect.
“Now, exclusively, Nick
Dunne breaks his silence,
not only on his wifeʼs
disappearance but on his
infidelity and all those
rumors.”

I feel a gust of warmth
toward Nick because heʼs
wearing my favorite tie
that I bought for him, that
he thinks, or thought, was
too girly-bright. Itʼs a
peacocky purple that turns
his eyes almost violet. Heʼs
lost his satisfied-asshole
paunch over the last
month: His belly is gone,
the fleshiness of his face
has vanished, his chin is

less clefty. His hair has
been trimmed but not cut
—I have an image of Go
hacking away at him just
before he went on camera,
slipping into Mama Moʼs
role, fussing over him,
doing the saliva-thumb
rubdown on some spot
near his chin. He is
wearing my tie and when
he lifts his hand to make a
gesture, I see he is wearing

my watch, the vintage
Bulova Spaceview that I
got him for his thirty-third
birthday, that he never
wore because it wasnʼt him,
even
though
it
was
completely him.
“Heʼs wonderfully well
groomed for a man who
thinks his wife is missing,”
Desi snipes. “Glad he
didnʼt skip a manicure.”
“Nick would never get

a
manicure,”
I
say,
glancing at Desiʼs buffed
nails.
“Letʼs get right to it,
Nick,” Sharon says. “Did
you have anything to do
with
your
wifeʼs
disappearance?”
“No. No. Absolutely,
one hundred percent not,”
Nick says, keeping wellcoached eye contact. “But
let me say, Sharon, I am

far,
far
from
being
innocent, or blameless, or
a good husband. If I
werenʼt so afraid for Amy,
I would say this was a
good thing, in a way, her
disappearing—”
“Excuse me, Nick, but I
think a lot of people will
find it hard to believe you
just said that when your
wife is missing.”
“Itʼs the most awful,

horrible feeling in the
world, and I want her back
more than anything. All I
am saying is that it has
been the most brutal eyeopener for me. You hate to
believe that you are such
an awful man that it takes
something like this to pull
you out of your selfishness
spiral and wake you up to
the fact that you are the
luckiest bastard in the

world. I mean, I had this
woman who was my equal,
my better, in every way,
and I let my insecurities—
about losing my job, about
not being able to care for
my family, about getting
older—cloud all that.”
“Oh, please—” Desi
starts, and I shush him. For
Nick to admit to the world
that he is not a good guy—
itʼs a small death, and not

of the petite mort variety.
“And Sharon, let me
say it. Let me say it right
now:
I
cheated.
I
disrespected my wife. I
didnʼt want to be the man
that I had become, but
instead of working on
myself, I took the easy way
out. I cheated with a
young woman who barely
knew me. So I could
pretend to be the big man. I

could pretend to be the
man I wanted to be—smart
and
confident
and
successful—because
this
young woman didnʼt know
any different. This young
girl, she hadnʼt seen me
crying into a towel in the
bathroom in the middle of
the night because I lost my
job. She didnʼt know all
my
foibles
and
shortcomings. I was a fool

who believed if I wasnʼt
perfect, my wife wouldnʼt
love me. I wanted to be
Amyʼs hero, and when I
lost my job, I lost my selfrespect. I couldnʼt be that
hero anymore. Sharon, I
know right from wrong.
And I just— I just did
wrong.”
“What would you say
to your wife, if she is
possibly out there, able to

see and hear you tonight?”
“Iʼd say: Amy, I love
you. You are the best
woman I have ever known.
You are more than I
deserve, and if you come
back, I will spend the rest
of my life making it up to
you. We will find a way to
put all this horror behind
us, and I will be the best
man in the world to you.
Please come home to me,

Amy.”
Just for a second, he
places the pad of his index
finger in the cleft of his
chin, our old secret code,
the one we did back in the
day to swear we werenʼt
bullshitting each other—
the dress really did look
nice, that article really was
solid. I am absolutely, one
hundred percent sincere right
now—I have your back, and

I wouldnʼt fuck with you.
Desi leans in front of
me to break my contact
with the screen and
reaches for the Sancerre.
“More wine, sweetheart?”
he says.
“Shhh.”
He pauses the show.
“Amy, you are a goodhearted woman. I know
you
are
susceptible
to … pleas. But everything

he is saying is lies.”
Nick is saying exactly
what I want to hear.
Finally.
Desi moves around so
he is staring at me fullface,
completely
obstructing my vision.
“Nick is putting on a
pageant. He wants to come
off as a good, repentant
guy. Iʼll admit heʼs doing a
bang-up job. But itʼs not

real—he
hasnʼt
even
mentioned beating you,
violating you. I donʼt know
what kind of hold this guy
has on you. It must be a
Stockholm-syndrome
thing.”
“I know,” I say. I know
exactly
what
I
am
supposed to say to Desi.
“Youʼre
right.
Youʼre
absolutely right. I havenʼt
felt so safe in so long, Desi,

but I am still … I see him
and … Iʼm fighting this,
but he hurt me … for
years.”
“Maybe we shouldnʼt
watch any more,” he says,
twirling my hair, leaning
too close.
“No, leave it on,” I say.
“I have to face this. With
you. I can do it with you.”
I put my hand in his. Now
shut the fuck up.

I just want Amy to come
home so I can spend the rest
of my life making it up to
her, treating her how she
deserves.
Nick forgives me—I
screwed you over, you
screwed me over, letʼs make
up. What if his code is
true? Nick wants me back.
Nick wants me back so he
can treat me right. So he
can spend the rest of his

life treating me the way he
should. It sounds rather
lovely. We could go back
to New York. Sales for the
Amazing Amy books have
skyrocketed
since
my
disappearance—three
generations of readers
have remembered how
much they love me. My
greedy,
stupid,
irresponsible parents can
finally pay back my trust

fund. With interest.
Because I want to go
back to my old life. Or my
old life with my old money
and my New Nick. LoveHonor-and-Obey
Nick.
Maybe heʼs learned his
lesson. Maybe heʼll be like
he was before. Because
Iʼve been daydreaming—
trapped in my Ozarks
cabin, trapped in Desiʼs
mansion compound, I have

a lot of time to daydream
and what Iʼve been
daydreaming of is Nick in
those early days. I thought
I would daydream more
about Nick getting assraped in prison, but I
havenʼt so much, not so
much, lately. I think about
those early, early days,
when we would lie in bed
next to each other, naked
flesh on cool cotton, and

he would just stare at me,
one finger tracing my jaw
from my chin to my ear,
making me wriggle, that
light tickling on my lobe,
and then through all the
seashell curves of my ear
and into my hairline, and
then heʼd take hold of one
lock of hair, like he did
that very first time we
kissed, and pull it all the
way to the end and tug

twice, gently, like he was
ringing a bell. And heʼd
say, “You are better than
any storybook, you are
better
than
anything
anyone could make up.”
Nick fastened me to the
earth. Nick wasnʼt like
Desi, who brought me
things I wanted (tulips,
wine) to make me do the
things he wanted (love
him). Nick just wanted me

to be happy, thatʼs all,
very
pure.
Maybe
I
mistook that for laziness. I
just want you to be happy,
Amy. How many times did
he say that and I took it to
mean: I just want you to be
happy, Amy, because thatʼs
less work for me. But
maybe I was unfair. Well,
not unfair but confused.
No one Iʼve loved has ever
not had an agenda. So how

could I know?
It really is true. It took
this awful situation for us
to realize it. Nick and I fit
together. I am a little too
much, and he is a little too
little. I am a thornbush,
bristling
from
the
overattention
of
my
parents, and he is a man of
a million little fatherly
stab wounds, and my
thorns fit perfectly into

them.
I need to get home to
him.

NICK DUNNE
FOURTEEN DAYS
GONE

I woke up on my
sisterʼs couch with a
raging hangover and an
urge to kill my wife. This
was fairly common in the
days after the Diary

Interview with the police.
Iʼd imagine finding Amy
tucked away in some spa
on the West Coast, sipping
pineapple juice on a divan,
her cares floating way, far
away, above a perfect blue
sky, and me, dirty, smelly
from an urgent crosscountry drive, standing in
front of her, blocking the
sun until she looks up, and
then my hands around her

perfect throat, with its
cords and hollows and the
pulse
thumping
first
urgently and then slowly
as we look into each
otherʼs eyes and at last
have some understanding.
I was going to be
arrested. If not today,
tomorrow;
if
not
tomorrow, the next day. I
had taken the fact that the
police let me walk out of

the station as a good sign,
but Tanner had shut me
down: “Without a body, a
conviction is incredibly
tough. Theyʼre just dotting
the Iʼs, crossing the Tʼs.
Spend these days doing
whatever you need to do,
because once the arrest
happens, weʼll be busy.”
Just
outside
the
window, I could hear the
rumbling of camera crews

—men
greeting
one
another good morning, as
if they were clocking in at
the factory. Cameras clickclick-clicked like restless
locusts, shooting the front
of Goʼs house. Someone
had leaked the discovery
of my “man cave” of goods
on my sisterʼs property,
my
imminent
arrest.
Neither of us had dared to
so much as flick at a

curtain.
Go walked into the
room in flannel boxers and
her high school Butthole
Surfers T-shirt, her laptop
in the crook of an arm.
“Everyone
hates
you
again,” she said.
“Fickle fucks.”
“Last night someone
leaked the information
about the shed, about
Amyʼs purse and the diary.

Now itʼs all: Nick Is a Liar,
Nick Is a Killer, Nick Is a
Lying
Killer.
Sharon
Schieber just released a
statement saying she was
very
shocked
and
disappointed
with
the
direction the case was
taking. Oh, and everyone
knows all about the porn—
Kill the Bitches.”
“Hurt the Bitch.”
“Oh, excuse me,” she

said. “Hurt the Bitch. So
Nick Is a Lying Killer-slashSexual Sadist. Ellen Abbott
is going to go fucking
rabid. Sheʼs a crazy antiporn lady.”
“Of course she is,” I
said. “Iʼm sure Amy is very
aware of that.”
“Nick?” she said in her
wake up voice. “This is
bad.”
“Go, it doesnʼt matter

what anyone else thinks,
we need to remember
that,” I said. “What matters
right now is what Amy is
thinking. If sheʼs softening
toward me.”
“Nick. You really think
she can go that fast from
hating you so much to
falling in love with you
again?”
It
was
the
fifth
anniversary
of
our

conversation on this topic.
“Go, yeah, I do. Amy
was never a person with
any
sort
of
bullshit
detector. If you said she
looked beautiful, she knew
that was a fact. If you said
she was brilliant, it wasnʼt
flattery, it was her due. So
yeah, I think a good chunk
of her truly believes that if
I can only see the error of
my ways, of course Iʼll be

in love with her again.
Because why in Godʼs
name wouldnʼt I be?”
“And if it turns out
sheʼs developed a bullshit
detector?”
“You know Amy; she
needs to win. Sheʼs less
pissed off that I cheated
than that I picked someone
else over her. Sheʼll want
me back just to prove that
sheʼs the winner. Donʼt

you agree? Just seeing me
begging her to come back
so I can worship her
properly, it will be hard
for her to resist. Donʼt you
think?”
“I think itʼs a decent
idea,” she said in the way
you might wish someone
good luck on the lottery.
“Hey, if youʼve got
something better, by all
fucking means.”

We snapped like that at
each other now. Weʼd
never done that before.
After the police found the
woodshed, they grilled Go,
hard, just as Tanner had
predicted: Did she know?
Did she help?
Iʼd expected her to
come home that night,
brimming
with
curse
words and fury, but all I
got was an embarrassed

smile as she slipped past
me to her room in the
house she had doublemortgaged
to
cover
Tannerʼs retainer.
I had put my sister in
financial
and
legal
jeopardy because of my
shitty decisions. The whole
situation made Go feel
resentful and me ashamed,
a lethal combination for
two people trapped in

small confines.
I tried a different
subject:
“Iʼve
been
thinking about phoning
Andie now that—”
“Yeah, that would be
genius-smart, Nick. Then
she can go back on Ellen
Abbott—”
“She didnʼt go on Ellen
Abbott. She had a press
conference
that
Ellen
Abbott carried. Sheʼs not

evil, Go.”
“She gave the press
conference because she
was pissed at you. I sorta
wish youʼd just kept
fucking her.”
“Nice.”
“What would you even
say to her?”
“Iʼm sorry.”
“You are definitely
fucking
sorry,”
she
muttered.

“I just— I hate how it
ended.”
“The last time you saw
Andie, she bit you,” Go
said in an overly patient
voice. “I donʼt think the
two of you have anything
else to say. You are the
prime suspect in a murder
investigation. You have
forfeited the right to a
smooth breakup. For fuckʼs
sake, Nick.”

We were growing sick
of each other, something I
never
thought
could
happen. It was more than
basic stress, more than the
danger Iʼd deposited on
Goʼs doorstep. Those ten
seconds just a week ago,
when Iʼd opened the door
of
the
woodshed,
expecting Go to read my
mind as always, and what
Go had read was that Iʼd

killed my wife: I couldnʼt
get over that, and neither
could she. I caught her
looking at me now and
then with the same steeled
chill with which she
looked at our father: just
another shitty male taking
up space. Iʼm sure I looked
at her through our fatherʼs
miserable eyes sometimes:
just another petty woman
resenting me.

I let out a gust of air,
stood up, and squeezed her
hand, and she squeezed
back.
“I think I should head
home,” I said. I felt a wave
of nausea. “I canʼt stand
this anymore. Waiting to
be arrested, I canʼt stand
it.”
Before she could stop
me, I grabbed my keys,
swung open the door, and

the
cameras
began
blasting,
the
shouts
exploded from a crowd
that was even larger than
Iʼd feared: Hey, Nick, did
you kill your wife? Hey,
Margo, did you help your
brother hide evidence?
“Fucking shitbags,” Go
spat. She stood next to me
in solidarity, in her
Butthole Surfers T-shirt
and
boxers.
A
few

protesters carried signs. A
woman with stringy blond
hair and sunglasses shook
a poster board: Nick, where
is AMY?
The shouts got louder,
frantic, baiting my sister:
Margo, is your brother a
wife killer? Did Nick kill his
wife and baby? Margo, are
you a suspect? Did Nick kill
his wife? Did Nick kill his
baby?

I stood, trying to hold
my ground, refusing to let
myself step back into the
house. Suddenly, Go was
crouching behind me,
cranking the spigot near
the steps. She turned on
the hose full-bore—a hard,
steady jet—and blasted all
those cameramen and
protesters
and
pretty
journalists in their TVready suits, sprayed them

like animals.
She was giving me
covering fire. I shot into
my car and tore off,
leaving them dripping on
the
front
lawn,
Go
laughing shrilly.
It took ten minutes for
me to nudge my car from
my driveway into my
garage, inching my way
slowly, slowly forward,
parting the angry ocean of

human beings—there were
at least twenty protesters
in front of my home, in
addition to the camera
crews. My neighbor Jan
Teverer was one of them.
She and I made eye
contact, and she aimed her
poster at me: WHERE IS
AMY, NICK?
Finally, I was inside,
and the garage door came
buzzing down. I sat in the

heat of the concrete space,
breathing.
Everywhere felt like a
jail now—doors opening
and closing and opening
and closing, and me never
feeling safe.
I spent the rest of my
day picturing how Iʼd kill
Amy. It was all I could
think of: finding a way to
end her. Me smashing in
Amyʼs busy, busy brain. I

had to give Amy her due: I
may have been dozing the
past few years, but I was
fucking wide awake now. I
was electric again, like I
had been in the early days
of our marriage.
I
wanted
to
do
something,
make
something happen, but
there was nothing to be
done. By late evening, the
camera crews were all

gone, though I couldnʼt
risk leaving the house. I
wanted to walk. I settled
for pacing. I was wired
dangerously tight.
Andie had screwed me
over, Marybeth had turned
against me, Go had lost a
crucial measure of faith.
Boney had trapped me.
Amy had destroyed me. I
poured a drink. I took a
slug, tightened my fingers

around the curves of the
tumbler, then hurled it at
the wall, watched the glass
burst into fireworks, heard
the tremendous shatter,
smelled the cloud of
bourbon. Rage in all five
senses.
Those
fucking
bitches.
Iʼd tried all my life to
be a decent guy, a man
who loved and respected
women, a guy without

hang-ups. And here I was,
thinking nasty thoughts
about my twin, about my
mother-in-law, about my
mistress. I was imagining
bashing in my wifeʼs skull.
A knock came at the
door, a loud, furious bangbang-bang that rattled me
out of my nightmare brain.
I opened the door,
flung it wide, greeting fury
with fury.

It was my father,
standing on my doorstep
like some awful specter
summoned
by
my
hatefulness.
He
was
breathing heavily and
sweating. His shirtsleeve
was torn and his hair was
wild, but his eyes had their
usual dark alertness that
made him seem viciously
sane.
“Is she here?” he

snapped.
“Who, Dad, who are
you looking for?”
“You know who.” He
pushed past me, started
marching through the
living room, trailing mud,
his hands balled, his
gravity
far
forward,
forcing him to keep
walking or fall down,
muttering bitchbitchbitch.
He smelled of mint. Real

mint, not manufactured,
and I saw a smear of green
on his trousers, as if heʼd
been stomping through
someoneʼs garden.
Little bitch that little
bitch, he kept muttering.
Through the dining room,
into the kitchen, flipping
on lights. A waterbug
scuttled up the wall.
I followed him, trying
to get him to calm down,

Dad, Dad, why donʼt you sit
down, Dad, do you want a
glass of water, Dad … He
stomped
downstairs,
clumps of mud falling off
his shoes. My hands
turtled into fists. Of course
this bastard would show
up and actually make
things worse.
“Dad!
Goddammit,
Dad! No one is here but
me. Just me.” He flung

open the guest room door,
then went back up to the
living room, ignoring me
—“Dad!”
I didnʼt want to touch
him. I was afraid Iʼd hit
him. I was afraid Iʼd cry.
I blocked him as he
tried to go upstairs to the
bedroom. I placed one
hand on the wall, one on
the
banister—human
barricade. “Dad! Look at

me.”
His words came out in
a furious spittle. “You tell
her, you tell that little ugly
bitch itʼs not over. Sheʼs
not better than me, you
tell her. Sheʼs not too good
for me. She doesnʼt get to
have a say. That ugly bitch
will have to learn—”
I swear I saw a blank
whiteness for just a
second, a moment of

complete, jarring clarity. I
stopped trying to block my
fatherʼs voice for once and
let it throb in my ears. I
was not that man: I didnʼt
hate and fear all women. I
was
a
one-woman
misogynist. If I despised
only Amy, focused all my
fury and rage and venom
on the one woman who
deserved it, that didnʼt
make me my father. That

made me sane.
Little bitch little bitch
little bitch.
I had never hated my
father more for making me
truly love those words.
Fucking bitch fucking
bitch.
I grabbed him by the
arm, hard, and herded him
into the car, slammed the
door. He repeated the
incantation all the way to

Comfort Hill. I pulled up
to the home in the entry
reserved for ambulances,
and I went to his side,
swung open the door,
yanked him out by the
arm, and walked him just
inside the doors.
Then I turned my back
and went home.
Fucking bitch fucking
bitch.
But there was nothing I

could do except beg. My
bitch wife had left me with
nothing but my sorry dick
in my hand, begging her to
come home. Print, online,
TV, wherever, all I could
do was hope my wife saw
me playing good husband,
saying the words she
wanted
me
to
say:
capitulation, complete. You
are right and I am wrong,
always. Come home to me

(you fucking cunt). Come
home so I can kill you.

AMY ELLIOTT
DUNNE
TWENTY-SIX
DAYS GONE

Desi is here again. He
is here almost every day
now, simpering around the
house, standing in the

kitchen as the setting sun
lights up his profile so I
can admire it, pulling me
by the hand into the tulip
room so I can thank him
again, reminding me how
safe and loved I am.
He says Iʼm safe and
loved even though he
wonʼt let me leave, which
doesnʼt make me feel safe
and loved. Heʼs left me no
car keys. Nor house keys

nor the gate security code.
I am literally a prisoner—
the gate is fifteen feet
high, and there are no
ladders in the house (Iʼve
looked). I could, I suppose,
drag several pieces of
furniture over to the wall,
pile them up, and climb
over, drop to the other
side, limp or crawl away,
but thatʼs not the point.
The point is, I am his

valued, beloved guest, and
a guest should be able to
leave when she wants. I
brought this up a few days
ago. “What if I need to
leave. Immediately?”
“Maybe I should move
in here,” he counters.
“Then I could be here all
the time and keep you
safe, and if anything
happens, we could leave
together.”

“What if your mom gets
suspicious and comes up
here and youʼre found
hiding me? It would be
awful.”
His mother. I would die
if his mother came up
here, because she would
report me immediately.
The woman despises me,
all because of that incident
back in high school—so
long ago, and she still

holds a grudge. I scratched
up my face and told Desi
she attacked me (the
woman was so possessive,
and so cold to me, she
might as well have). They
didnʼt talk for a month.
Clearly, theyʼve made up.
“Jacqueline
doesnʼt
know the code,” he says.
“This is my lake house.” He
pauses and pretends to
think. “I really should

move up here. Itʼs not
healthy for you to spend so
many hours by yourself.”
But Iʼm not by myself,
not that much. We have a
bit of a routine established
in just two weeks. Itʼs a
routine mandated by Desi,
my posh jailer, my spoiled
courtier. Desi arrives just
after
noon,
always
smelling of some expensive
lunch heʼs devoured with

Jacqueline at some whitelinened restaurant, the
kind of restaurant he could
take me to if we moved to
Greece. (This is the other
option
he
repeatedly
presents: We could move
to Greece. For some
reason, he believes I will
never be identified in a
tiny little fishing village in
Greece where he has
summered many times,

and where I know he
pictures us sipping the
wine, making lazy sunset
love, our bellies full of
octopus.) He smells of
lunch as he enters, he
wafts it. He must dab
goose liver behind his ears
(the way his mother
always smelled vaguely
vaginal—food and sex, the
Collings reek of, not a bad
strategy).

He enters, and he
makes my mouth water.
The smell. He brings me
something nice to eat, but
not as nice as what heʼs
had: Heʼs thinning me up,
he always preferred his
women waify. So he brings
me lovely green star fruit
and spiky artichokes and
spiny crab, anything that
takes
elaborate
preparation and yields

little in return. I am almost
my normal weight again,
and my hair is growing
out. I wear it back in a
headband he brought me,
and I have colored it back
to my blond, thanks to
hair dye he also brought
me: “I think you will feel
better about yourself when
you start looking more like
yourself, sweetheart,” he
says. Yes, itʼs all about my

well-being, not the fact
that he wants me to look
exactly like I did before.
Amy circa 1987.
I eat lunch as he hovers
near me, waiting for the
compliments. (To never
have to say those words—
thank you—again. I donʼt
remember
Nick
ever
pausing to allow me—
force me—to thank him.) I
finish lunch, and he tidies

up as best as he knows
how. We are two people
unaccustomed to cleaning
up after ourselves; the
place is beginning to look
lived in—strange stains on
countertops,
dust
on
windowsills.
Lunch concluded, Desi
fiddles with me for a
while: my hair, my skin,
my clothes, my mind.
“Look at you,” heʼll say,

tucking my hair behind my
ears the way he likes it,
unbuttoning my shirt one
notch and loosening it at
the neck so he can look at
the hollow of my clavicle.
He puts a finger in the
little indentation, filling
the gap. It is obscene.
“How can Nick have hurt
you, have not loved you,
have cheated on you?” He
continually
hits
these

points, verbally poking a
bruise. “Wouldnʼt it be so
lovely to just forget about
Nick, those awful five
years, and move on? You
have that chance, you
know, to completely start
over with the right man.
How many people can say
that?”
I do want to start over
with the right man, the
New Nick. Things are

looking bad for him, dire.
Only I can save Nick from
me. But I am trapped.
“If you ever left here
and I didnʼt know where
you were, Iʼd have to go to
the police,” he says. “Iʼd
have no choice. Iʼd need to
make sure you were safe,
that
Nick
wasnʼt … holding you
somewhere against your
will. Violating you.”

A threat disguised as
concern.
I look at Desi with
outright
disgust
now.
Sometimes I feel my skin
must be hot with repulsion
and with the effort to keep
that repulsion hidden. Iʼd
forgotten about him. The
manipulation, the purring
persuasion, the delicate
bullying. A man who finds
guilt erotic. And if he

doesnʼt get his way, heʼll
pull his little levers and set
his punishment in motion.
At least Nick was man
enough to go stick his dick
in something. Desi will
push and push with his
waxy, tapered fingers until
I give him what he wants.
I thought I could
control Desi, but I canʼt. I
feel like something very
bad is going to happen.

NICK DUNNE
THIRTY-THREE
DAYS GONE

The days were loose
and long, and then they
smashed into a wall. I
went out to get groceries

one August morning, and I
came home to find Tanner
in my living room with
Boney and Gilpin. On the
table, inside a plastic
evidence bag, was a long
thick club with delicate
grooves for fingers.
“We found this just
down the river from your
home on that first search,”
Boney said. “Didnʼt look
like anything at the time,

really. Just some of the
weird
flotsam
on
a
riverbank, but we keep
everything in a search like
that. After you showed us
your Punch and Judy
dolls, it clicked. So we got
the lab to check it out.”
“And?” I said. Toneless.
Boney stood up, looked
me right in the eye. She
sounded sad. “We were
able to detect Amyʼs blood

on it. This case is now
classified as a homicide.
And we believe this to be
the murder weapon.”
“Rhonda, come on!”
“Itʼs time, Nick,” she
said. “Itʼs time.”
The next part was
starting.

AMY ELLIOTT
DUNNE
FORTY DAYS
GONE

I have found a piece of
old twine and an empty
wine bottle, and Iʼve been
using them for my project.

Also some vermouth, of
course. I am ready.
Discipline. This will
take discipline and focus. I
am up to the task.
I array myself in Desiʼs
favorite look: delicate
flower. My hair in loose
waves, perfumed. My skin
has paled after a month
inside.
I
am
almost
without makeup: a flip of
mascara, pink-pink cheeks,

and clear lip gloss. I wear
a clingy pink dress he
bought me. No bra. No
panties. No shoes, despite
the air-conditioned chill. I
have a fire crackling and
perfume in the air, and
when he arrives after
lunch without invitation, I
greet him with pleasure. I
wrap my arms around him
and bury my face in his
neck. I rub my cheek

against his. I have been
increasingly sweeter to
him the past few weeks,
but this is new, this
clinging.
“Whatʼs
this,
sweetheart?”
he
says,
surprised and so pleased
that I almost feel ashamed.
“I had the worst
nightmare last night,” I
whisper. “About Nick. I
woke up, and all I wanted

was to have you here. And
in the morning … Iʼve
spent all day wishing you
were here.”
“I can always be here,
if you like.”
“I would,” I say, and I
turn my face up to him
and let him kiss me. His
kiss disgusts me; itʼs nibbly
and hesitant, like a fish.
Itʼs Desi being respectful of
his raped, abused woman.

He nibbles again, wet cold
lips, his hands barely on
me, and I just want this all
over, I want it done, so I
pull him to me and push
his lips open with my
tongue. I want to bite him.
He pulls back. “Amy,”
he says. “Youʼve been
through a lot. This is fast. I
donʼt want you to do this
fast if you donʼt want to. If
youʼre not sure.”

I know heʼs going to
have to touch my breasts, I
know heʼs going to have to
push himself inside me,
and I want it over, I can
barely restrain myself from
scratching him: the idea of
doing this slowly.
“Iʼm sure,” I say. “I
guess Iʼve been sure since
we were sixteen. I was just
afraid.”
This means nothing,

but I know it will get him
hard.
I kiss him again, and
then I ask him if he will
take me into our bedroom.
In the bedroom, he
begins
undressing
me
slowly, kissing parts of my
body that have nothing to
do with sex—my shoulder,
my ear—while I delicately
guide him away from my
wrists and ankles. Just

fuck me, for Christʼs sake.
Ten minutes in and I grab
his hand and thrust it
between my legs.
“Are you sure?” he
says, pulling back from
me, flushed, a loop of his
hair falling over his
forehead, just like in high
school. We could be back
in my dorm room, for all
the progress Desi has
made.

“Yes, darling,” I say,
and I reach modestly for
his cock.
Another ten minutes
and heʼs finally between
my legs, pumping gently,
slowly, slowly, making
love. Pausing for kisses and
caresses until I grab him
by the buttocks and begin
pushing him. “Fuck me,” I
whisper, “fuck me hard.”
He stops. “It doesnʼt

have to be like that, Amy.
Iʼm not Nick.”
Very true. “I know,
darling, I just want you
to … to fill me. I feel so
empty.”
That gets him. I
grimace over his shoulder
as he thrusts a few more
times and comes, me
realizing it almost too late
—Oh, this is his pathetic
cum-sound—and
faking

quick oohs and ahhs,
gentle kittenish noises. I
try to work up some tears
because
I
know
he
imagines me crying with
him the first time.
“Darling,
youʼre
crying,” he says as he slips
out of me. He kisses a tear.
“Iʼm just happy,” I say.
Because thatʼs what those
kinds of women say.
I have mixed up some

martinis, I announce—Desi
loves a decadent afternoon
drink—and
when
he
makes a move to put on
his shirt and fetch them, I
insist he stay in bed.
“I
want
to
do
something for you for a
change,” I say.
So I scamper into the
kitchen and get two big
martini glasses, and into
mine I put gin and a single

olive. Into his I put three
olives, gin, olive juice,
vermouth, and the last of
my sleeping pills, three of
them, crushed.
I bring the martinis,
and there is snuggling and
nuzzling, and I slurp my
gin while this happens. I
have an edge that must be
dulled.
“Donʼt you like my
martini?” I ask when he

has only a sip. “I always
pictured being your wife
and making you martinis. I
know thatʼs silly.”
I begin a pout.
“Oh, darling, not silly
at all. I was just taking my
time, enjoying. But—” He
guzzles the whole thing
down. “If it makes you feel
better!”
He
is
giddy,
triumphant. His cock is

slick with conquest. He is,
basically, like all men.
Soon he is sleepy, and
after that he is snoring.
And I can begin.

GETS GIRL
BACK (OR
VICE

VERSA)

NICK DUNNE
FORTY
DAYS
GONE

Out on bond, awaiting
trial. Iʼd been processed
and
released—the
depersonalized
in-and-

outing of jail, the bond
hearing, the fingerprints
and photos, the rotating
and the shuffling and the
handling; it didnʼt make me
feel like an animal, it
made me feel like a
product,
something
created on an assembly
line. What they were
creating was Nick Dunne,
Killer. It would be months
until weʼd begin my trial

(my trial: the word still
threatened to undo me
completely, turn me into a
high-pitched giggler, a
madman). I was supposed
to feel privileged to be out
on bond: I had stayed put
even when it was clear I
was going to be arrested,
so I was deemed no flight
risk. Boney might have put
in a good word for me too.
So I got to be in my own

home for a few more
months before I was carted
off to prison and killed by
the state.
Yes, I was a lucky,
lucky man.
It was mid-August,
which I found continually
strange: Itʼs still summer,
Iʼd think. How can so much
have happened and itʼs not
even autumn? It was
brutally warm. Shirtsleeve

weather, was how my
mom
would
have
described it, forever more
concerned
with
her
childrenʼs comfort than the
actual
Fahrenheit.
Shirtsleeve weather, jacket
weather,
overcoat
weather, parka weather—
the Year in Outerwear. For
me this year, it would be
handcuff weather, then
possibly
prison-jumpsuit

weather. Or funeral-suit
weather, because I didnʼt
plan on going to prison. Iʼd
kill myself first.
Tanner had a team of
five detectives trying to
track Amy down. So far,
nothing. Like trying to
catch water. Every day for
weeks, Iʼd done my little
shitty part: videotape a
message to Amy and post
it on young Rebeccaʼs

Whodunnit blog. (Rebecca,
at least, had remained
loyal.) In the videos, I
wore clothes Amy had
bought me, and I brushed
my hair the way she liked,
and I tried to read her
mind. My anger toward
her was like heated wire.
The
camera
crews
parked themselves on my
lawn most mornings. We
were like rival soldiers,

rooted in shooting distance
for months, eyeing each
other across no-manʼsland, achieving some sort
of perverted fraternity.
There was one guy with a
voice like a cartoon
strongman
whom
Iʼd
become attached to, sight
unseen. He was dating a
girl he really, really liked.
Every morning his voice
boomed in through my

windows as he analyzed
their dates; things seemed
to be going very well. I
wanted to hear how the
story ended.
I finished my evening
taping to Amy. I was
wearing a green shirt she
liked on me, and Iʼd been
telling her the story of
how we first met, the party
in Brooklyn, my awful
opening line, just one olive,

that embarrassed me every
time Amy mentioned it. I
talked about our exit from
the
oversteamed
apartment out into the
crackling cold, with her
hand in mine, the kiss in
the cloud of sugar. It was
one of the few stories we
told the same way. I said it
all in the cadence of a
bedtime tale: soothing and
familiar and repetitive.

Always ending with Come
home to me, Amy.
I turned off the camera
and sat back on the couch
(I always filmed while
sitting on the couch under
her
pernicious,
unpredictable
cuckoo
clock, because I knew if I
didnʼt show her cuckoo
clock,
sheʼd
wonder
whether I had finally
gotten rid of her cuckoo

clock, and then sheʼd stop
wondering whether I had
finally gotten rid of her
cuckoo clock and simply
come to believe it was
true, and then no matter
what sweet words came
out of my mouth, sheʼd
silently counter with: “and
yet he tossed out my cuckoo
clock”). The cuckoo was, in
fact, soon to pop out, its
grinding windup beginning

over my head—a sound
that inevitably made my
jaw
tense—when
the
camera
crews
outside
emitted a loud, collective,
oceanic
wushing.
Somebody was here. I
heard the seagull cries of a
few female news anchors.
Something is wrong, I
thought.
The doorbell rang three
times in a row: Nick-nick!

Nick-nick! Nick-nick!
I didnʼt hesitate. I had
stopped hesitating over the
past month: Bring on the
trouble posthaste.
I opened the door.
It was my wife.
Back.
Amy Elliott Dunne
stood barefoot on my
doorstep in a thin pink
dress that clung to her as if
it were wet. Her ankles

were ringed in dark violet.
From one limp wrist
dangled a piece of twine.
Her hair was short and
frayed at the ends, as if it
had
been
carelessly
chopped by dull scissors.
Her face was bruised, her
lips swollen. She was
sobbing.
When she flung her
arms out toward me, I
could see her entire

midsection was stained
with dried blood. She tried
to speak; her mouth
opened, once, twice, silent,
a mermaid washed ashore.
“Nick!”
she
finally
keened—a
wail
that
echoed against all the
empty houses—and fell
into my arms.
I wanted to kill her.
Had we been alone, my
hands might have found

their place around her
neck, my fingers locating
perfect grooves in her
flesh. To feel that strong
pulse
under
my
fingers … but we werenʼt
alone, we were in front of
cameras, and they were
realizing who this strange
woman was, they were
coming to life as sure as
the cuckoo clock inside, a
few clicks, a few questions,

then an avalanche of noise
and light. The cameras
were blasting us, the
reporters closing in with
microphones,
everyone
yelling
Amyʼs
name,
screaming,
literally
screaming. So I did the
right thing, I held her to
me and howled her name
right back: “Amy! My God!
My God! My darling!” and
buried my face in her

neck, my arms wrapped
tight around her, and let
the cameras get their
fifteen seconds, and I
whispered deep inside her
ear, “You fucking bitch.”
Then I stroked her hair, I
cupped her face in my two
loving hands, and I yanked
her inside.
Outside our door, a
rock
concert
was
demanding its encore:

Amy! Amy! Amy! Someone
threw a scattering of
pebbles at our window.
Amy! Amy! Amy!
My wife took it all as
her due, fluttering a
dismissive hand toward
the rabble outside. She
turned to me with a worn
but triumphant smile—the
smile on the rape victim,
the abuse survivor, the bed
burner in the old TV

movies, the smile where
the bastard has finally
received due justice and
we know our heroine will
be able to move on with
life! Freeze frame.
I gestured to the twine,
the hacked hair, the dried
blood. “So, whatʼs your
story, wife?”
“Iʼm
back,”
she
whimpered. “I made it
back to you.” She moved

to put her arms around
me. I moved away.
“What is your story,
Amy?”
“Desi,” she whispered,
her lower lip trembling.
“Desi Collings took me. It
was the morning. Of. Of
our anniversary. And the
doorbell rang, and I
thought … I donʼt know, I
thought maybe it was
flowers from you.”

I flinched. Of course
sheʼd find a way to work
in a gripe: that I hardly
ever sent her flowers,
when her dad had sent her
mom flowers each week
since theyʼd been married.
Thatʼs 2,444 bouquets of
flowers vs. 4.
“Flowers
or … something,” she
continued. “So I didnʼt
think, I just flung open the

door. And there he stood,
Desi, with this look on his
face. Determined. As if
heʼd been girding himself
up for this all along. And I
was
holding
the
handle … to the Judy
puppet. Did you find the
puppets?” She smiled up at
me tearily. She looked so
sweet.
“Oh, I found everything
you left for me, Amy.”

“I had just found the
handle to the Judy puppet
—it had fallen off—I was
holding it when I opened
the door, and I tried to hit
him, and we struggled,
and he clubbed me with it.
Hard. And the next thing I
knew …”
“You had framed me
for
murder
and
disappeared.”
“I
can
explain

everything, Nick.”
I stared at her a long
hard moment. I saw days
under the hot sun stretched
across the sand of the
beach, her hand on my
chest, and I saw family
dinners at her parentsʼ
house, with Rand always
refilling my glass and
patting
me
on
the
shoulder, and I saw us
sprawled on the rug in my

crummy
New
York
apartment, talking while
staring at the lazy ceiling
fan, and I saw mother of
my child and the stunning
life Iʼd planned for us
once. I had a moment that
lasted two beats, one, two,
when I wished violently
that she were telling the
truth.
“I actually donʼt think
you
can
explain

everything,” I said. “But I
am going to love watching
you try.”
“Try me now.”
She tried to take my
hand, and I flung her off. I
walked away from her,
took a breath, and then
turned to face her. My wife
must always be faced.
“Go ahead, Nick. Try
me now.”
“Okay, sure. Why was

every clue of the treasure
hunt hidden in a place
where I had … relations
with Andie?”
She sighed, looked at
the floor. Her ankles were
raw. “I didnʼt even know
about Andie until I saw it
on TV … while I was tied
to Desiʼs bed, hidden away
in his lake house.”
“So
that
was
all … coincidence?”

“Those were all places
that were meaningful to
us,” she said. A tear slid
down her face. “Your
office, where you reignited
your
passion
for
journalism.”
I snuffed.
“Hannibal, where I
finally understood how
much this area means to
you. Your fatherʼs house—
confronting the man who

hurt you so much. Your
motherʼs house, which is
now Goʼs house, the two
people who made you such
a good man. But … I guess
it doesnʼt surprise me that
youʼd like to share those
places
with
someone
you”—she bowed her head
—“had fallen in love with.
You always liked repeats.”
“Why did each of those
places end up including

clues that implicated me in
your murder? Womenʼs
undies, your purse, your
diary. Explain your diary,
Amy, with all the lies.”
She just smiled and
shook her head like she
was
sorry
for
me.
“Everything, I can explain
everything,” she said.
I looked in that sweet
tear-stained face. Then I
looked down at all the

blood. “Amy. Whereʼs
Desi?”
She shook her head
again, a sad little smile.
I moved to call the
police, but a knock on our
door told me they were
already here.

AMY ELLIOTT
DUNNE
THE NIGHT OF
THE RETURN

I still have Desiʼs
semen inside me from the
last time he raped me, so
the medical examination

goes fine. My ropewreathed
wrists,
my
damaged
vagina,
my
bruises—the
body
I
present them is textbook.
An older male doctor with
humid breath and thick
fingers performs the pelvic
exam—scraping
and
wheezing in time—while
Detective Rhonda Boney
holds my hand. It is like
being clutched by a cold

bird claw. Not comforting
at all. Once she breaks into
a grin when she thinks Iʼm
not
looking.
She
is
absolutely thrilled that
Nick isnʼt a bad guy after
all. Yes, the women of
America are collectively
sighing.
Police
have
been
dispatched to Desiʼs home,
where theyʼll find him
naked and drained, a

stunned look on his face, a
few strands of my hair in
his clutches, the bed
soaked in blood. The knife
I used on him, and on my
bonds, will be nearby on
the floor where I dropped
it, dazed, and walked
barefoot, carrying nothing
out of the house but his
keys—to the car, to the
gate—and climbed, still
slick with his blood, into

his vintage Jaguar and
returned like some longlost faithful pet, straight
back home to my husband.
Iʼd been reduced to an
animal state; I didnʼt think
of anything but getting
back to Nick.
The old doctor tells me
the
good
news;
no
permanent damage and no
need
for
a
D&C—I
miscarried
too
early.

Boney keeps clutching my
hand and murmuring, My
God, what youʼve been
through, do you think you
feel up to answering a few
questions? That fast, from
condolences to brass tacks.
I find ugly women are
usually overly deferential
or incredibly rude.
You are Amazing Amy,
and youʼve survived a
brutal
kidnapping

involving
repeated
assaults. Youʼve killed
your captor, and youʼve
made it back to a husband
youʼve discovered was
cheating. You:
a) Put yourself first
and demand some
time alone to collect
yourself.
b) Hold it together
just a little longer so
you can help the

police.
c) Decide which
interview to give first
—you might as well
get something out of
the ordeal, like a book
deal.
Answer:
B.
Amazing Amy always
puts others first.
Iʼm allowed to clean
myself up in a private
room in the hospital, and I

change into a set of clothes
Nick put together for me
from the house—jeans
with creases from being
folded too long, a pretty
blouse that smells of dust.
Boney and I drive from the
hospital to the police
station in near silence. I
ask weakly after my
parents.
“Theyʼre waiting for
you at the station,” Boney

says. “They wept when I
told them. With joy.
Absolute joy and relief.
Weʼll let them get some
good hugs in with you
before
we
do
our
questions, donʼt worry.”
The
cameras
are
already at the station. The
parking lot has that
hopeful, overlit look of a
sports stadium. There is no
underground parking, so

we have to pull right up
front as the madding
crowd closes in: I see wet
lips and spittle as everyone
screams questions, the
pops of flashbulbs and
camera lights. The crowd
pushes and pulls en masse,
jerking a few inches to the
right, then the left, as
everyone tries to reach me.
“I canʼt do this,” I say
to Boney. A manʼs meaty

palm smacks against the
car
window
as
a
photographer tries to keep
his balance. I grab her cold
hand. “Itʼs too much.”
She pats me and says,
wait. The station doors
open, and every officer in
the building files down the
stairs and forms a line on
either side of me, holding
the press back, creating an
honor guard for me, and

Rhonda and I run in
holding hands like reverse
newlyweds,
rushing
straight up to my parents
who are waiting just inside
the doorway, and everyone
gets the photos of us
clutching each other with
my
mom
whispering
sweetgirlsweetgirlsweetgirl
and my dad sobbing so
loudly he almost chokes.

There is more whisking
away of me, as if I havenʼt
been whisked away quite
enough already. I am
deposited in a closet of a
room with comfortable but
cheap office chairs, the
kind that always seem to
have bits of old food
woven into the fabric. A
camera blinking up in the
corner and no windows. It
is not what I pictured. It is

not designed to make me
feel safe.
I am surrounded by
Boney, her partner, Gilpin,
and two FBI agents up
from St. Louis who remain
nearly silent. They give me
water, and then Boney
starts.
B: Okay, Amy, first
we have to thank you
sincerely for talking
with us after what

youʼve been through.
In a case like this, itʼs
very important to get
everything
down
while the memory is
fresh.
You
canʼt
imagine
how
important that is. So
itʼs good to talk now.
If we can get all these
details down, we can
close the case, and
you and Nick can go

back to your lives.
A: Iʼd definitely
like that.
B: You deserve
that. So if youʼre
ready to begin, can we
start with the time
line: What time did
Desi arrive at your
door?
Do
you
remember?
A: About ten A.M.
A little after, because I

remember hearing the
Teverers talking as
they walked to their
car for church.
B: What happened
when you opened the
door?
A: Something felt
wrong immediately.
First of all, Desi has
written me letters all
my life. But his
obsession seemed to

have become less
intense over the years.
He seemed to think of
himself as just an old
friend, and since the
police couldnʼt do
anything about it, I
made my peace with
that. I never felt like
he meant me active
harm,
although
I
really
didnʼt
like
being this close to

him. Geographically. I
think thatʼs what put
him over the edge.
Knowing I was so
close. He walked into
my house with … He
was sweaty and sort of
nervous
but
also
determined-looking.
Iʼd been upstairs, Iʼd
been about to iron my
dress, when I noticed
the
big
wooden

handle of the Judy
puppet on the floor—I
guess it had fallen off.
Bummer because Iʼd
already hidden the
puppets
in
the
woodshed.
So
I
grabbed the handle,
and I had that in my
hand when I opened
the door.
B:
Very
good
memory.

A: Thank you.
B: What happened
next?
A: Desi barged in,
and he was pacing
around the living
room, all flustered and
kind of frantic, and he
said, What are you
doing
for
your
anniversary?
It
frightened me, that he
knew today was our

anniversary, and he
seemed angry about
it, and then his arm
flashed out and he
had me by the wrist
and was twisting it
behind my back, and
we struggled. I put up
a real fight.
B: What next?
A: I kicked him
and got away for a
second and ran to the

kitchen,
and
we
struggled more and he
clubbed me once with
the big wooden Judy
handle, and I went
flying and then he hit
me two or three more
times. I remember not
being able to see for a
second, just dizzy, my
head was throbbing
and I tried to grab for
the handle and he

stabbed my arm with
this pocketknife he
was carrying. I still
have the scar. See?
B: Yes, that was
noted in your medical
examination.
You
were lucky it was only
a flesh wound.
A: It doesnʼt feel
like a flesh wound,
believe me.
B: So he stabbed

you? The angle is—
A: Iʼm not sure if
he did it on purpose,
or if I thrust myself
onto
the
blade
accidentally—I was so
off
balance.
I
remember the club
falling to the floor,
though, and I looked
down and saw my
blood from the stab
wound pooling over

the club. I think I
passed out then.
B: Where were you
when you woke up?
A: I woke up hogtied in my living
room.
B: Did you scream,
try
to
get
the
neighborsʼ attention?
A: Of course I
screamed. I mean, did
you hear me? I was

beaten, stabbed, and
hog-tied by a man
who
had
been
obsessed with me for
decades, who once
tried to kill himself in
my dorm bedroom.
B: Okay, okay,
Amy, Iʼm sorry, that
question
was
not
intended in the least
to sound like we are
blaming you; we just

need to get a full
picture here so we can
close the investigation
and you can get on
with your life. Do you
want another water,
or
coffee
or
something?
A:
Something
warm would be nice.
Iʼm so cold.
B: No problem.
Can you get her a

coffee?
So
what
happened then?
A: I think his
original plan was to
subdue me and kidnap
me and let it look like
a runaway-wife thing,
because when I wake
up, heʼs just finished
mopping the blood in
the kitchen, and heʼs
straightened the table
of
little
antique

ornaments that fell
over when I ran to the
kitchen. Heʼs gotten
rid of the club. But
heʼs running out of
time, and I think what
must have happened
is: He sees this
disheveled
living
room—and
so
he
thinks, Leave it. Let it
look like something bad
happened here. So he

throws the front door
open, and then he
knocks a few more
things over in the
living
room.
Overturns
the
ottoman. So thatʼs
why the scene looked
so weird: It was half
true and half false.
B: Did Desi plant
incriminating items at
each of the treasure

hunt
sites:
Nickʼs
office, Hannibal, his
dadʼs house, Goʼs
woodshed?
A: I donʼt know
what you mean?
B: There was a pair
of
womenʼs
underwear, not your
size, in Nickʼs office.
A: I guess it must have
been the girl he
was … dating. B: Not

hers either.
A: Well, I canʼt
help on that one.
Maybe he was seeing
more than one girl.
B: Your diary was
found in his fatherʼs
house. Partly burned
in the furnace.
A: Did you read the
diary? Itʼs awful. Iʼm
sure Nick did want to
get rid of it—I donʼt

blame
him,
considering you guys
zeroed in on him so
quickly.
B: I wonder why
he would go to his
fatherʼs to burn it.
A: You should ask
him. (Pause.) Nick
went there a lot, to be
alone. He likes his
privacy. So Iʼm sure it
didnʼt feel that odd to

him. I mean, he
couldnʼt do it at our
house, because itʼs a
crime
scene—who
knows if you guys will
come
back,
find
something
in
the
ashes. At his dadʼs, he
has some discretion. I
thought it was a smart
move, considering you
guys were basically
railroading him.

B: The diary is
very, very concerning.
The
diary
alleges
abuse and your fears
that Nick didnʼt want
the baby, that he
might want to kill
you.
A: I really do wish
that diary had burned.
(Pause.) Let me be
honest: The diary
includes
some
of

Nickʼs
and
my
struggles these past
few years. It doesnʼt
paint the greatest
picture
of
our
marriage or of Nick,
but I have to admit: I
never wrote in the
diary unless I was
super-happy, or I was
really, really unhappy
and wanted to vent
and then … I can get a

little dramatic when
itʼs just me stewing on
things. I mean, a lot of
that is the ugly truth
—he did shove me
once, and he didnʼt
want a baby, and he
did
have
money
problems. But me
being afraid of him? I
have to admit, it pains
me to admit, but
thatʼs my dramatic

streak. I think the
problem is, Iʼve been
stalked several times
—itʼs been a lifelong
issue—people getting
obsessed with me—
and so I get a little
paranoid.
B: You tried to buy
a gun.
A: I get a lot
paranoid, okay? Iʼm
sorry. If you had my

history,
youʼd
understand.
B: Thereʼs an entry
about a night of
drinks
when
you
suffered from what
sounds like textbook
antifreeze poisoning.
A: (Long silence.)
Thatʼs bizarre. Yes, I
did get ill.
B: Okay, back to
the treasure hunt. You

did hide the Punch
and Judy dolls in the
woodshed?
A: I did.
B: A lot of our case
has focused on Nickʼs
debt, some extensive
credit-card purchases,
and our discovery of
all those items hidden
in
the
woodshed.
What did you think
when you opened the

woodshed and saw all
this stuff?
A: I was on Goʼs
property, and Go and I
arenʼt especially close,
so mostly, I felt like I
was nosing around in
something that wasnʼt
my
business.
I
remember thinking at
the time that it must
have been her stuff
from New York. And

then I saw on the
news—Desi made me
watch
everything—
that it corresponded
with Nickʼs purchases,
and … I knew Nick
had
some
money
troubles, he was a
spender. I think he
was
probably
embarrassed. Impulse
purchases he couldnʼt
undo, so he hid them

from me until he
could sell them online.
B: The Punch and
Judy puppets, they
seem a little ominous
for an anniversary
present.
A: I know! Now I
know.
I
didnʼt
remember the whole
backstory of Punch
and Judy. I was just
seeing a husband and

wife and a baby, and
they were made of
wood, and I was
pregnant. I scanned
the Internet and saw
Punchʼs line: Thatʼs
the way to do it! And I
thought it was cute—I
didnʼt know what it
meant.
B: So you were
hog-tied. How did
Desi get you to the

car?
A: He pulled the
car into the garage
and
lowered
the
garage door, dragged
me in, threw me in
the trunk, and drove
away.
B: And did you yell
then?
A: Yes, I fucking
yelled. And if Iʼd
known that, every

night for the next
month, Desi was going
to rape me, then
snuggle in next to me
with a martini and a
sleeping pill so he
wouldnʼt be awakened
by my sobbing, and
that the police were
going
to
actually
interview him and still
not have a clue, still
sit around with their

thumbs up their asses,
I might have yelled
harder. Yes, I might
have.
B:
Again,
my
apologies. Can we get
Ms.
Dunne
some
tissues, please? And
whereʼs her coff—
Thank you. Okay,
where did you go
from there, Amy?
A:
We
drove

toward St. Louis, and I
remember on the way
there he stopped at
Hannibal—I heard the
steamboat whistle. I
guess thatʼs when he
threw my purse out. It
was the one other
thing he did so it
would look like foul
play.
B: This is so
interesting.
There

seem to be so many
strange coincidences
in this case. Like, that
Desi would happen to
toss out the purse
right at Hannibal,
where
your
clue
would make Nick go
—and we in turn
would believe that
Nick tossed the purse
there. Or how you
decided to hide a

present in the very
place where Nick was
hiding goods heʼd
bought
on
secret
credit cards.
A: Really? I have
to tell you, none of
this
sounds
like
coincidence to me. It
sounds like a bunch of
cops who got hung up
on my husband being
guilty, and now that I

am alive and heʼs
clearly not guilty, they
look like giant idiots,
and
theyʼre
scrambling to cover
their asses. Instead of
accepting
responsibility for the
fact that, if this case
had been left in your
extremely
fucking
incompetent
hands,
Nick would be on

death row and Iʼd be
chained to a bed,
being raped every day
from now until I died.
B: Iʼm sorry, itʼs—
A: I saved myself,
which saved Nick,
which saved your
sorry fucking asses.
B: That is an
incredibly good point,
Amy. Iʼm sorry, weʼre
so … Weʼve spent so

long on this case, we
want to figure out
every detail that we
missed so we donʼt
repeat our mistakes.
But youʼre absolutely
right, weʼre missing
the big picture, which
is: You are a hero. You
are an absolute hero.
A: Thank you. I
appreciate you saying
that.

NICK DUNNE
THE NIGHT OF
THE RETURN

I went to the station to
fetch my wife and was
greeted by the press like a
rock
star–landslide

president–first
moonwalker all in one. I
had to resist raising
clasped hands above my
head in the universal
victory shake. I see, I
thought,
weʼre
all
pretending to be friends now.
I entered a scene that
felt like a holiday party
gone awry—a few bottles
of champagne rested on
one desk, surrounded by

tiny
paper
cups.
Backslapping and cheers
for all the cops, and then
more cheers for me, as if
these people hadnʼt been
my persecutors a day
before. But I had to play
along. Present the back for
slapping. Oh yes, weʼre all
buddies now.
All that matters is that
Amy is safe. Iʼd been
practicing that line over

and over. I had to look like
the
relieved,
doting
husband until I knew
which way things were
going to go. Until I was
sure the police had sawed
through all her sticky
cobwebby lies. Until she is
arrested— Iʼd get that far,
until she is arrested, and
then I could feel my brain
expand
and
deflate
simultaneously—my own

cerebral Hitchcock zoom—
and Iʼd think: My wife
murdered a man.
“Stabbed him,” said the
young
police
officer
assigned as the family
liaison. (I hoped never to
be liaisoned again, with
anyone, for any reason.)
He was the same kid
whoʼd yammered on to Go
about his horse and torn
labrum and peanut allergy.

“Cut him right through the
jugular. Cut like that, he
bleeds out in, like, sixty
seconds.”
Sixty seconds is a long
time to know you are
dying. I could picture Desi
wrapping his hands around
his neck, the feel of his
own
blood
spurting
between his fingers with
each pulse, and Desi
getting more frightened

and the pulsing only
quickening … and then
slowing, and Desi knowing
the slowing was worse.
And all the time Amy
standing just out of reach,
studying him with the
blameful, disgusted look of
a high school biology
student confronted with a
dripping pig fetus. Her
little scalpel still in hand.
“Cut him with a big ole

butcher knife,” the kid was
saying. “Guy used to sit
right next to her on the
bed, cut up her meat for
her, and feed her.” He
sounded more disgusted by
this than by the stabbing.
“One day the knife slips off
the plate, he never notices
—”
“Howʼd she use the
knife if she was always
tied up?” I asked.

The kid looked at me as
if Iʼd just told a joke about
his mother. “I donʼt know,
Mr. Dunne, Iʼm sure
theyʼre getting the details
right now. The point is,
your wife is safe.”
Hurray. Kid stole my
line.
I spotted Rand and
Marybeth through the
doorway of the room
where weʼd given our first

press conference six weeks
ago. They were leaning in
to each other, as always,
Rand kissing the top of
Marybethʼs
head,
Marybeth nuzzling him
back, and I felt such a
keen sense of outrage that
I almost threw a stapler at
them. You two worshipful,
adoring assholes created that
thing down the hall and set
her loose on the world. Lo,

how jolly, what a perfect
monster! And do they get
punished? No, not a single
person had come forth to
question their characters;
theyʼd
experienced
nothing but an outpouring
of love and support, and
Amy would be restored to
them and everyone would
love her more.
My
wife
was
an
insatiable
sociopath

before. What would she
become now?
Step carefully, Nick, step
very carefully.
Rand caught my eye
and motioned me to join
them. He shook my hand
for
a
few
exclusive
reporters
whoʼd
been
granted
an
audience.
Marybeth held her ground:
I was still the man whoʼd
cheated on her daughter.

She gave a curt nod and
turned away.
Rand leaned in close to
me so I could smell his
spearmint gum. “I tell you,
Nick, we are so relieved to
have Amy back. We owe
you an apology too. Big
one. Weʼll let Amy decide
how she feels about your
marriage, but I want to at
least apologize for where
things went. Youʼve got to

understand—”
“I do,” I said. “I
understand everything.”
Before Rand could
apologize
or
engage
further, Tanner and Betsy
arrived together, looking
like a Vogue spread—crisp
slacks and jewel-toned
shirts and gleaming gold
watches and rings—and
Tanner leaned toward my
ear and whispered, Let me

see where we are, and then
Go was rushing in, all
alarmed
eyes
and
questions: What does this
mean? What happened to
Desi? She just showed up on
your doorstep? What does
this mean? Are you okay?
What happens next?
It
was
a
bizarre
gathering—the feel of it:
not quite reunion, not
quite hospital waiting

room,
celebratory
yet
anxious, like some parlor
game where no one had all
the rules. Meanwhile, the
two reporters the Elliotts
allowed into the inner
sanctum kept snapping
questions at me: How great
does it feel to have Amy
back? How wonderful do
you feel right now? How
relieved are you, Nick, that
Amy has returned?

Iʼm extremely relieved
and very happy, I was
saying, crafting my own
bland PR statement, when
the doors parted and
Jacqueline
Collings
entered, her lips a tight
red scar, her face powder
lined with tears.
“Where is she?” she
said to me. “The lying little
bitch, where is she? She
killed my son. My son.”

She began crying as the
reporter snapped a few
photos.
How do you feel that
your son was accused of
kidnap and rape? one
reporter asked in a stiff
voice.
“How do I feel?” she
snapped. “Are you actually
serious? Do people really
answer questions like that?
That nasty, soulless girl

manipulated my son his
entire life—write this down
—she manipulated and
lied and finally murdered
him, and now, even after
heʼs dead, sheʼs still using
him—”
“Ms. Collings, weʼre
Amyʼs parents,” Marybeth
was beginning. She tried to
touch Jacqueline on the
shoulder, and Jacqueline
shook her off. “I am sorry

for your pain.”
“But not my loss.”
Jacqueline stood a good
head taller than Marybeth;
she glared down on her.
“But not my loss,” she
reasserted.
“Iʼm
sorry
about
…
everything,”
Marybeth said, and then
Rand was next to her, a
head
taller
than
Jacqueline.

“What are you going to
do about your daughter?”
Jacqueline asked. She
turned toward our young
liaison officer, who tried to
hold his ground. “What is
being done about Amy?
Because she is lying when
she says my son kidnapped
her. She is lying. She killed
him, she murdered him in
his sleep, and no one
seems to be taking this

seriously.”
“Itʼs all being taken
very,
very
seriously,
maʼam,” the young kid
said.
“Can I get a quote, Ms.
Collings?”
asked
the
reporter.
“I just gave you my
quote. Amy Elliott Dunne
murdered my son. It was
not
self-defense.
She
murdered him.”

“Do you have proof of
that?”
Of course she didnʼt.
The reporterʼs story
would
chronicle
my
husbandly exhaustion (his
drawn face telling of too
many nights forfeited to
fear) and the Elliottsʼ relief
(the two parents cling to
each other as they wait for
their only child to be
officially returned to them).

It would discuss the
incompetence of the cops
(it was a biased case, full of
dead ends and wrong turns,
with the police department
focused doggedly on the
wrong man). The article
would dismiss Jacqueline
Collings in a single line:
After an awkward run-in
with the Elliott parents, an
embittered
Jacqueline
Collings was ushered out of

the room, claiming her son
was innocent.
Jacqueline was indeed
ushered out of the room
into another, where her
statement
would
be
recorded and she would be
kept out of the way of the
much better story: the
Triumphant Return of
Amazing Amy.
When
Amy
was
released to us, it all began

again. The photos and the
tears, the hugging and the
laughter, all for strangers
who wanted to see and to
know: What was it like?
Amy, what does it feel like
to escape your captor and
return to your husband?
Nick, what does it feel like
to get your wife back, to get
your freedom back, all at
once?
I
remained
mostly

silent. I was thinking my
own questions, the same
questions Iʼd thought for
years, the ominous refrain
of our marriage: What are
you thinking, Amy? How are
you feeling? Who are you?
What have we done to each
other? What will we do?
It was a gracious,
queenly act for Amy to
want to come home to our
marriage bed with her

cheating
husband.
Everyone
agreed.
The
media followed us as if we
were a royal wedding
procession, the two of us
whizzing
through
the
neon, fast-food-cluttered
streets of Carthage to our
McMansion on the river.
What grace Amy has, what
moxie.
A
storybook
princess. And I, of course,
was
the
lickspittle

hunchback of a husband
who would bow and
scrape the rest of my days.
Until she was arrested. If
she ever got arrested.
That she was released
at all was a concern. More
than a concern, an utter
shock. I saw them all filing
out of the conference room
where they questioned her
for four hours and then let
her go: two FBI guys with

alarmingly short hair and
blank
faces;
Gilpin,
looking
like
heʼd
swallowed the greatest
steak dinner of his life; and
Boney, the only one with
thin, tight lips and a little
V of a frown. She glanced
at me as she walked past,
arched an eyebrow, and
was gone.
Then, too quickly, Amy
and I were back in our

home, alone in the living
room, Bleecker watching
us with shiny eyes. Outside
our curtains, the lights of
the TV cameras remained,
bathing our living room in
a bizarrely lush orange
glow. We looked candlelit,
romantic.
Amy
was
absolutely beautiful. I
hated her. I was afraid of
her.
“We canʼt really sleep

in the same house—” I
began.
“I want to stay here
with you.” She took my
hand. “I want to be with
my husband. I want to
give you the chance to be
the kind of husband you
want to be. I forgive you.”
“You forgive me? Amy,
why did you come back?
Because of what I said in
the
interviews?
The

videos?”
“Wasnʼt that what you
wanted?” she said. “Wasnʼt
that the point of the
videos? They were perfect
—they reminded me of
what we used to have,
how special it was.”
“What I said, that was
just me saying what you
wanted to hear.”
“I know—thatʼs how
well you know me!” Amy

said. She beamed. Bleecker
began
figure-eighting
between her legs. She
picked him up and stroked
him.
His
purr
was
deafening. “Think about it,
Nick, we know each other.
Better than anyone in the
world now.”
It was true that Iʼd had
this feeling too, in the past
month, when I wasnʼt
wishing Amy harm. It

would come to me at
strange moments—in the
middle of the night, up to
take a piss, or in the
morning pouring a bowl of
cereal—Iʼd detect a nib of
admiration, and more than
that, fondness for my wife,
right in the middle of me,
right in the gut. To know
exactly what I wanted to
hear in those notes, to woo
me back to her, even to

predict all my wrong
moves … the woman knew
me cold. Better than
anyone in the world, she
knew me. All this time Iʼd
thought we were strangers,
and it turned out we knew
each other intuitively, in
our bones, in our blood.
It
was
kind
of
romantic. Catastrophically
romantic.
“We canʼt just pick up

where we were, Amy.”
“No, not where we
were,” she said. “Where we
are now. Where you love
me and youʼll never do
wrong again.”
“Youʼre crazy, youʼre
literally crazy if you think
Iʼm going to stay. You
killed a man,” I said. I
turned my back to her, and
then I pictured her with a
knife in her hand and her

mouth growing tight as I
disobeyed her. I turned
back around. Yes, my wife
must always be faced.
“To escape him.”
“You killed Desi so you
had a new story, so you
could come back and be
beloved Amy and not ever
have to take the blame for
what you did. Donʼt you
get it, Amy, the irony? Itʼs
what you always hated

about me—that I never
dealt
with
the
consequences
of
my
actions, right? Well, my
ass has been well and duly
consequenced. So what
about you? You murdered a
man, a man I assume loved
you and was helping you,
and now you want me to
step in his place and love
you and help you, and … I
canʼt. I cannot do it. I

wonʼt do it.”
“Nick, I think youʼve
gotten
some
bad
information,” she said. “It
doesnʼt surprise me, all the
rumors that are going
about. But we need to
forget all that. If we are to
go forward. And we will
go forward. All of America
wants us to go forward.
Itʼs the story the world
needs right now. Us. Desiʼs

the bad guy. No one wants
two bad guys. They want
to like you, Nick. The only
way you can be loved
again is to stay with me.
Itʼs the only way.”
“Tell
me
what
happened, Amy. Was Desi
helping you all along?”
She flared at that: She
didnʼt need a manʼs help,
even though she clearly
had needed a manʼs help.

“Of course not!” she
snapped.
“Tell me. What can it
hurt, tell me everything,
because you and I canʼt go
forward with this pretend
story. Iʼll fight you every
step of the way. I know
youʼve
thought
of
everything. Iʼm not trying
to get you to slip up—Iʼm
tired of trying to outthink
you, I donʼt have it in me.

I just want to know what
happened. I was a step
away from death row,
Amy. You came back and
saved me, and I thank you
for that—do you hear me?
I thank you, so donʼt say I
didnʼt later on. I thank
you. But I need to know.
You know I need to know.”
“Take off your clothes,”
she said.
She wanted to make

sure I wasnʼt wearing a
wire. I undressed in front
of her, removed every
stitch, and then she
surveyed me, ran a hand
across my chin and my
chest, down my back. She
palmed my ass and slipped
her hand between my legs,
cupped my testicles and
gripped my limp cock,
held it in her hand for a
moment to see if anything

happened.
Nothing
happened.
“Youʼre clean,” she
said. It was meant as a
joke, a wisecrack, a movie
reference weʼd both laugh
at. When I said nothing,
she stepped back and said,
“I always did like looking
at you naked. That made
me happy.”
“Nothing made you
happy. Can I put my

clothes back on?”
“No. I donʼt want to
worry about hidden wires
in the cuffs or the hems.
Also, we need to go in the
bathroom and run the
water. In case you bugged
the house.”
“Youʼve seen too many
movies,” I said.
“Ha! Never thought Iʼd
hear you say that.”
We stood in the

bathtub and turned on the
shower. The water sprayed
my naked back and misted
the front of Amyʼs shirt
until she peeled it off. She
pulled off all her clothes, a
gleeful striptease, and
tossed them over the
shower stall in the same
grinning, game manner
she had when we first met
—Iʼm up for anything!—and
she turned to me, and I

waited for her to swing her
hair around her shoulders
like she did when she
flirted with me, but her
hair was too short.
“Now weʼre even,” she
said. “Seemed rude to be
the only one clothed.”
“I think weʼre past
etiquette, Amy.”
Look only at her eyes, do
not touch her, do not let her
touch you.

She moved toward me,
put a hand on my chest,
let the water trickle
between her breasts. She
licked a shower teardrop
off her upper lip and
smiled. Amy hated shower
spray. She didnʼt like
getting her face wet, didnʼt
like the feel of water
pelleting her flesh. I knew
this because I was married
to her, and Iʼd pawed her

and harassed her many
times in the shower,
always to be turned down.
(I know it seems sexy, Nick,
but itʼs actually not, itʼs
something people only do in
movies.) Now she was
pretending
just
the
opposite, as if she forgot
that I knew her. I backed
away.
“Tell me everything,
Amy. But first: Was there

ever a baby?”
The baby was a lie. It
was the most desolate part
for me. My wife as a
murderer was frightening,
repulsive, but the baby as
a lie was almost impossible
to bear. The baby was a
lie, the fear of blood was a
lie—during the past year,
my wife had been mostly a
lie.
“How did you set Desi

up?” I asked.
“I found some twine in
one
corner
of
his
basement. I used a steak
knife to saw it into four
pieces—”
“He let you keep a
knife?”
“We were friends. You
forget.”
She was right. I was
thinking of the story sheʼd
told the police: that Desi

had held her captive. I did
forget. She was that good a
storyteller.
“Whenever Desi wasnʼt
around, Iʼd tie the pieces
as tight as I could around
my wrists and ankles so
theyʼd
leave
these
grooves.”
She showed me the
lurid lines on her wrists,
like bracelets.
“I took a wine bottle,

and I abused myself with it
every day, so the inside of
my vagina looked … right.
Right for a rape victim.
Then today I let him have
sex with me so I had his
semen, and I slipped some
sleeping pills into his
martini.”
“He let you keep
sleeping pills?”
She sighed: I wasnʼt
keeping up.

“Right,
you
were
friends.”
“Then
I—”
She
pantomimed slicing his
jugular.
“That easy, huh?”
“You just have to
decide to do it and then do
it,” she said. “Discipline.
Follow
through.
Like
anything.
You
never
understood that.”
I could feel her mood

turning stony. I wasnʼt
appreciating her enough.
“Tell me more,” I said.
“Tell me how you did it.”
An hour in, the water
went cold, and Amy called
an end to our discussion.
“You have to admit, itʼs
pretty brilliant,” she said.
I stared at her.
“I mean, you have to
admire it just a little,” she
prompted.

“How long did it take
for Desi to bleed to
death?”
“Itʼs time for bed,” she
said. “But we can talk
more tomorrow if you
want. Right now we
should sleep. Together. I
think itʼs important. For
closure.
Actually,
the
opposite of closure.”
“Amy, Iʼm going to stay
tonight because I donʼt

want to deal with all the
questions if I donʼt stay.
But Iʼll sleep downstairs.”
She cocked her head to
one side, studied me.
“Nick, I can still do
very bad things to you,
remember that.”
“Ha! Worse than what
youʼve already done?”
She looked surprised.
“Oh, definitely.”
“I doubt that, Amy.”

I began walking out the
door.
“Attempted
murder,”
she said.
I paused.
“That was my original
plan early on: Iʼd be a
poor, sick wife with
repeated episodes, sudden
intense bouts of illness,
and then it turns out that
all those cocktails her
husband prepared her …”

“Like in the diary.”
“But
I
decided
attempted murder wasnʼt
good enough for you. It
had to be bigger than that.
Still, I couldnʼt get the
poisoning idea out of my
head. I liked the idea of
you working up to the
murder.
Trying
the
cowardly way first. So I
went through with it.”
“You expect me to

believe that?”
“All that vomit, so
shocking. An innocent,
frightened wife might have
saved some of that vomit,
just in case. You canʼt
blame her, being a little
paranoid.” She gave a
satisfied smile. “Always
have a backup plan to the
backup plan.”
“You actually poisoned
yourself.”

“Nick, please, youʼre
shocked? I killed myself.”
“I need a drink,” I said.
I left before she could
speak.
I poured myself a
Scotch and sat on the
living-room couch. Beyond
the curtains, the strobes of
the cameras were lighting
up the yard. Soon it would
no longer be night. Iʼd
come to find the morning

depressing, to know it
would come again and
again.
Tanner picked up on
the first ring.
“She killed him,” I said.
“She killed Desi because he
was basically … he was
annoying her, he was
power-playing her, and she
realized she could kill him,
and it was her way back to
her old life, and she could

blame everything on him.
She murdered him, Tanner,
she just told me this. She
confessed.”
“I donʼt suppose you
were able to … record any
of it somehow? Cell phone
or something?”
“We were naked with
the shower running, and
she whispered everything.”
“I donʼt even want to
ask,” he said. “You two are

the most fucked-up people
I have ever met, and I
specialize in fucked-up
people.”
“Whatʼs going on with
the police?”
He
sighed.
“She
foolproofed
everything.
Itʼs ludicrous, her story,
but no more ludicrous
than our story. Amyʼs
basically exploiting the
sociopathʼs most reliable

maxim.”
“Whatʼs that?”
“The bigger the lie, the
more they believe it.”
“Come on, Tanner,
thereʼs
got
to
be
something.”
I paced over to the
staircase to make sure
Amy was nowhere nearby.
We were whispering, but
still. I had to be careful
now.

“For now we need to
toe the line, Nick. She left
you looking fairly bad:
Everything in the diary
was true, she says. All the
stuff in the woodshed was
you. You bought the stuff
with those credit cards,
and
youʼre
too
embarrassed to admit it.
Sheʼs just a sheltered little
rich girl, what would she
know about acquiring

secret credit cards in her
husbandʼs name? And my
goodness,
that
pornography!”
“She told me there was
never a baby, she faked it
with Noelle Hawthorneʼs
pee.”
“Why didnʼt you say—
Thatʼs huge! Weʼll lean on
Noelle Hawthorne.”
“Noelle didnʼt know.”
I heard a deep sigh on

the other end. He didnʼt
even bother asking how.
“Weʼll keep thinking, weʼll
keep looking,” he said.
“Something will break.”
“I canʼt stay in this
house with that thing.
Sheʼs threatening me with
—”
“Attempted
murder … the antifreeze.
Yeah, I heard that was in
the mix.”

“They canʼt arrest me
on that, can they? She says
she still has some vomit.
Evidence. But can they
really—”
“Letʼs not push it for
now, okay, Nick?” he said.
“For now, play nice. I hate
to say it, I hate to, but
thatʼs my best legal advice
for you right now: Play
nice.”
“Play nice? Thatʼs your

advice? My one-man legal
dream team: Play nice?
Fuck you.”
I hung up in full fury.
Iʼll kill her, I thought. I
will fucking kill the bitch.
I plunged into the dark
daydream Iʼd indulged
over the past few years
when Amy had made me
feel
my
smallest:
I
daydreamed of hitting her
with a hammer, smashing

her head in until she
stopped talking, finally,
stopped with the words
she suctioned to me:
average, boring, mediocre,
unsurprising, unsatisfying,
unimpressive.
Un,
basically. In my mind, I
whaled on her with the
hammer until she was like
a broken toy, muttering
un, un, un until she
sputtered to a stop. And

then it wasnʼt enough, so I
restored her to perfection
and began killing her
again: I wrapped my
fingers around her neck—
she always did crave
intimacy—and
then
I
squeezed and squeezed,
her pulse—
“Nick?”
I turned around, and
Amy was on the bottom
stair in her nightgown, her

head tilted to one side.
“Play nice, Nick.”

AMY ELLIOTT
DUNNE
THE NIGHT OF
THE RETURN

He turns around, and
when he sees me standing
there, he looks scared.
Thatʼs something useful.

Because Iʼm not going to
let him go. He may think
he was lying when he said
all those nice things to lure
me home. But I know
different. I know Nick
canʼt lie like that. I know
that as he recited those
words, he realized the
truth. Ping! Because you
canʼt be as in love as we
were and not have it
invade your bone marrow.

Our kind of love can go
into remission, but itʼs
always waiting to return.
Like the worldʼs sweetest
cancer.
You donʼt buy it? Then
how about this? He did lie.
He didnʼt mean a fucking
thing he said. Well, then,
screw him, he did too good
a job, because I want him,
exactly like that. The man
he was pretending to be—

women love that guy. I
love that guy. Thatʼs the
man I want for my
husband. Thatʼs the man I
signed up for. Thatʼs the
man I deserve.
So he can choose to
truly love me the way he
once did, or I will bring
him to heel and make him
be the man I married. Iʼm
sick of dealing with his
bullshit.

“Play nice,” I say.
He looks like a child, a
furious child. He bunches
his fists.
“No, Amy.”
“I can ruin you, Nick.”
“You
already
did,
Amy.” I see the rage flash
over him, a shiver. “Why
in Godʼs name do you even
want to be with me? Iʼm
boring,
average,
uninteresting, uninspiring.

Iʼm not up to par. You
spent the last few years
telling me this.”
“Only because you
stopped trying,” I say. “You
were so perfect, with me.
We were so perfect when
we started, and then you
stopped trying. Why would
you do that?”
“I stopped loving you.”
“Why?”
“You stopped loving

me. Weʼre a sick, fucking
toxic Möbius strip, Amy.
We
werenʼt
ourselves
when we fell in love, and
when we became ourselves
—surprise!—we
were
poison. We complete each
other in the nastiest,
ugliest possible way. You
donʼt really love me, Amy.
You donʼt even like me.
Divorce me. Divorce me,
and letʼs try to be happy.”

“I wonʼt divorce you,
Nick. I wonʼt. And I swear
to you, if you try to leave,
I will devote my life to
making your life as awful
as I can. And you know I
can make it awful.”
He begins pacing like a
caged bear. “Think about
it, Amy, how bad we are
for each other: the two
most
needful
human
beings in the world stuck

with each other. Iʼll
divorce you if you donʼt
divorce me.”
“Really?”
“I will divorce you. But
you should divorce me.
Because I know what
youʼre thinking already,
Amy. Youʼre thinking it
wonʼt make a good story:
Amazing Amy finally kills
her crazed-rapist captor
and returns home to … a

boring old divorce. Youʼre
thinking
itʼs
not
triumphant.”
Itʼs not triumphant.
“But think of it this
way: Your story is not
some
drippy,
earnest
survivor story. TV movie
circa 1992. Itʼs not. You
are a tough, vibrant,
independent woman, Amy.
You killed your kidnapper,
and then you kept on

cleaning house: You got
rid of your idiot cheat of a
husband. Women would
cheer you. Youʼre not a
scared little girl. Youʼre a
badass, take-no-prisoners
woman. Think about it.
You know Iʼm right: The
era of forgiveness is over.
Itʼs passé. Think of all the
women—the
politiciansʼ
wives, the actresses—every
woman in the public whoʼs

been cheated on, they
donʼt stay with the cheat
these days. Itʼs not stand
by your man anymore, itʼs
divorce the fucker.”
I feel a rush of hate
toward him, that heʼs still
trying to wriggle out of
our marriage even though
Iʼve told him—three times
now—that he canʼt. He
still thinks he has power.
“And if I donʼt divorce

you, youʼll divorce me?” I
ask.
“I donʼt want to be
married to a woman like
you. I want to be married
to a normal person.”
Piece of shit.
“I see. You want to
revert to your lame, limp
loser self? You want to just
walk away? No! You donʼt
get to go be some boringass middle American with

some boring-ass girl next
door. You tried it already
—remember, baby? Even if
you wanted to, you
couldnʼt do that now.
Youʼll be known as the
philandering asshole who
left his kidnapped, raped
wife. You think any nice
woman will touch you?
Youʼll only get—”
“Psychos? Crazy psycho
bitches?” Heʼs pointing at

me, jabbing the air.
“Donʼt call me that.”
“Psycho bitch?”
Itʼd be so easy, for him
to write me off that way.
Heʼd love that, to be able
to dismiss me so simply.
“Everything I do, I do
for a reason, Nick,” I say.
“Everything I do takes
planning and precision and
discipline.”
“You are a petty,

selfish,
manipulative,
disciplined psycho bitch
—”
“You are a man,” I say.
“You are an average, lazy,
boring, cowardly, womanfearing man. Without me,
thatʼs what you would
have kept on being, ad
nauseam. But I made you
into something. You were
the best man youʼve ever
been with me. And you

know it. The only time in
your life youʼve ever liked
yourself was pretending to
be someone I might like.
Without me? Youʼre just
your dad.”
“Donʼt say that, Amy.”
He balls up his fists.
“You think he wasnʼt
hurt by a woman too, just
like you?” I say it in my
most patronizing voice, as
if Iʼm talking to a puppy.

“You think he didnʼt
believe he deserved better
than he got, just like you?
You really think your mom
was his first choice? Why
do you think he hated you
all so much?”
He moves toward me.
“Shut up, Amy.”
“Think, Nick, you know
Iʼm right: Even if you
found a nice, regular girl,
youʼd be thinking of me

every day. Tell me you
wouldnʼt.”
“I wouldnʼt.”
“How quickly did you
forget little Able Andie
once you thought I loved
you again?” I say it in my
poor-baby voice. I even
stick out my lower lip.
“One love note, sweetie?
Did one love note do it?
Two? Two notes with me
swearing I loved you and I

wanted you back, and I
thought you were just great
after all—was that it for
you? You are WITTY, you
are WARM, you are
BRILLIANT.
Youʼre
so
pathetic. You think you
can ever be a normal man
again? Youʼll find a nice
girl, and youʼll still think
of me, and youʼll be so
completely
dissatisfied,
trapped in your boring,

normal life with your
regular wife and your two
average kids. Youʼll think
of me and then youʼll look
at your wife, and youʼll
think: Dumb bitch.”
“Shut up, Amy. I mean
it.”
“Just like your dad.
Weʼre all bitches in the
end, arenʼt we, Nick?
Dumb bitch, psycho bitch.”
He grabs me by the

arm and shakes me hard.
“Iʼm the bitch who
makes you better, Nick.”
He stops talking then.
He is using all his energy
to keep his hands at his
side. His eyes are wet with
tears. He is shaking.
“Iʼm the bitch who
makes you a man.”
Then his hands are on
my neck.

NICK DUNNE
THE NIGHT OF
THE RETURN

Her pulse was finally
throbbing beneath my
fingers, the way Iʼd
imagined. I pressed tighter
and brought her to the
ground. She made wet

clucking
noises
and
scratched at my wrists. We
were both kneeling, in
face-to-face prayer for ten
seconds.
You fucking crazy bitch.
A tear fell from my
chin and hit the floor.
You murdering, mindfucking, evil, crazy bitch.
Amyʼs bright blue eyes
were staring into mine,
unblinking.

And then the strangest
thought of all clattered
drunkenly from the back
of my brain to the front
and blinded me: If I kill
Amy, who will I be?
I saw a bright white
flash. I dropped my wife as
if she were burning iron.
She sat hard on the
ground, gasped, coughed.
When her breath came
back, it was in jagged

rasps, with a strange,
almost erotic squeak at the
end.
Who will I be then? The
question
wasnʼt
recriminatory. It wasnʼt
like the answer was the
pious: Then youʼll be a
killer, Nick. Youʼll be as bad
as Amy. Youʼll be what
everyone thought you were.
No. The question was
frighteningly soulful and

literal: Who would I be
without Amy to react to?
Because she was right: As
a man, I had been my most
impressive when I loved
her—and I was my next
best self when I hated her.
I had known Amy only
seven years, but I couldnʼt
go back to life without her.
Because she was right: I
couldnʼt return to an
average life. Iʼd known it

before sheʼd said a word.
Iʼd already pictured myself
with a regular woman—a
sweet, normal girl next
door—and Iʼd already
pictured
telling
this
regular woman the story of
Amy, the lengths she had
gone to—to punish me and
to return to me. I already
pictured this sweet and
mediocre
girl
saying
something
uninteresting

like Oh, nooooo, oh my
God, and I already knew
part of me would be
looking
at
her
and
thinking: Youʼve never
murdered for me. Youʼve
never framed me. You
wouldnʼt even know how to
begin to do what Amy did.
You could never possibly
care that much. The
indulged mamaʼs boy in
me wouldnʼt be able to

find peace with this
normal woman, and pretty
soon she wouldnʼt just be
normal,
sheʼd
be
substandard, and then my
fatherʼs voice—dumb bitch
—would rise up and take it
from there.
Amy was exactly right.
So maybe there was no
good end for me.
Amy was toxic, yet I
couldnʼt imagine a world

without her entirely. Who
would I be with Amy just
gone? There were no
options that interested me
anymore. But she had to
be brought to heel. Amy in
prison, that was a good
ending for her. Tucked
away in a box where she
couldnʼt inflict herself on
me but where I could visit
her from time to time. Or
at least imagine her. A

pulse, my pulse, left out
there somewhere.
It had to be me who
put her there. It was my
responsibility. Just as Amy
took the credit for making
me my best self, I had to
take
the
blame
for
bringing the madness to
bloom in Amy. There were
a million men who would
have loved, honored, and
obeyed
Amy
and

considered
themselves
lucky to do so. Confident,
self-assured, real men who
wouldnʼt have forced her
to pretend to be anything
but her own perfect, rigid,
demanding,
brilliant,
creative,
fascinating,
rapacious, megalomaniac
self.
Men capable of being
uxorious.
Men capable of keeping

her sane.
Amyʼs story could have
gone a million other ways,
but she met me, and bad
things happened. So it was
up to me to stop her.
Not kill her but stop
her.
Put her in one of her
boxes.

AMY ELLIOTT
DUNNE
FIVE DAYS
AFTER THE
RETURN

I know, I know for sure
now, that I need to be
more careful about Nick.

Heʼs not as tame as he
used to be. Something in
him is electric; a switch
has turned on. I like it. But
I need to take precautions.
I need one more
spectacular precaution.
It will take some time
to put in place, this
precaution. But Iʼve done
it before, the planning. In
the meantime, we can
work on our rebuilding.

Start with the facade. We
will
have
a
happy
marriage if it kills him.
“Youʼre going to have
to try again to love me,” I
told him. The morning
after he almost killed me.
It happened to be Nickʼs
thirty-fifth birthday, but
he didnʼt mention it. My
husband has had enough
of my gifts.
“I forgive you for last

night,” I said. “We were
both under a lot of stress.
But now youʼre going to
have to try again.”
“I know.”
“Things will have to be
different,” I said.
“I know,” he said.
He doesnʼt really know.
But he will.
My parents have visited
daily. Rand and Marybeth
and Nick lavish me with

attention.
Pillows.
Everyone wants to offer
me pillows: We are all
laboring under a mass
psychosis that my rape and
miscarriage have left me
forever achy and delicate.
I have a permanent case of
sparrowʼs bones—I must
be held gently in the palm,
lest I break.
So I prop my feet on
the infamous ottoman, and

I tread delicately over the
kitchen floor where I bled.
We must take good care of
me.
Yet I find it strangely
tense to watch Nick with
anyone but me. He seems
on the edge of blurting all
the time—as if his lungs
are bursting with words
about me, damning words.
I need Nick, I realize. I
actually need him to back

my story. To stop his
accusations and denials
and admit that it was him:
the credit cards, the
goodies in the woodshed,
the bump in insurance.
Otherwise I will carry that
waft
of
uncertainty
forever. I have only a few
loose ends, and those loose
ends are people. The
police, the FBI, they are
sifting through my story.

Boney, I know, would love
to arrest me. But they
botched everything so
badly before—they look
like such fools—that they
canʼt touch me unless they
have proof. And they donʼt
have proof. They have
Nick, who swears he didnʼt
do the things I swear he
did, and thatʼs not much,
but itʼs more than Iʼd like.
Iʼve even prepared in

case my Ozarks friends Jeff
and Greta show up, nosing
around for acclaim or
cash. Iʼve already told the
police: Desi didnʼt drive us
straight to his home. He
kept me blindfolded and
gagged and drugged for
several days—I think it was
several days—in some
room, maybe a motel
room?
Maybe
an
apartment? I canʼt be sure,

itʼs all such a blur. I was so
frightened, you know, and
the sleeping pills. If Jeff
and Greta show their
pointy, lowdown faces and
somehow convince the
cops to send a tech team
down to the Hide-A-Way,
and one of my fingerprints
or a hair is found, that
simply solves part of the
puzzle. The rest is them
telling lies.

So Nick is really the
only issue, and soon Iʼll
return him to my side. I
was smart, I left no other
evidence. The police may
not entirely believe me,
but
they
wonʼt
do
anything. I know from the
petulant tone in Boneyʼs
voice—she will live in
permanent
exasperation
from now on, and the
more annoyed she gets,

the more people will
dismiss her. She already
has the righteous, eyerolling cadence of a
conspiracy crackpot. She
might as well wrap her
head in foil.
Yes, the investigation is
winding down. But for
Amazing Amy, itʼs quite
the opposite. My parentsʼ
publisher
placed
an
abashed plea for another

Amazing Amy book, and
they acquiesced for a
lovely fat sum. Once again
they are squatting on my
psyche, earning money for
themselves.
They
left
Carthage this morning.
They say itʼs important for
Nick and me (the correct
grammar) to have some
time alone and heal. But I
know the truth. They want
to get to work. They tell

me they are trying to “find
the right tone.” A tone that
says: Our daughter was
kidnapped and repeatedly
raped by a monster she had
to stab in the neck … but
this is in no way a cash
grab.
I donʼt care about the
rebuilding of their pathetic
empire, because every day
I get calls to tell my story.
My story: mine, mine,

mine. I just need to pick
the very best deal and start
writing. I just need to get
Nick on the same page so
that we both agree how
this
story
will
end.
Happily.
I know Nick isnʼt in
love with me yet, but he
will be. I do have faith in
that. Fake it until you
make it, isnʼt that an
expression? For now he

acts like the old Nick, and
I act like the old Amy.
Back when we were
happy. When we didnʼt
know each other as well as
we do now. Yesterday I
stood on the back porch
and watched the sun come
up over the river, a
strangely
cool
August
morning, and when I
turned around, Nick was
studying me from the

kitchen window, and he
held up a mug of coffee
with a question: You want
a cup? I nodded, and soon
he was standing beside
me, the air smelling of
grass,
and
we
were
drinking
our
coffee
together and watching the
water, and it felt normal
and good.
He wonʼt sleep with me
yet. He sleeps in the

downstairs guest room
with the door locked. But
one day I will wear him
down, I will catch him off
guard, and he will lose the
energy for the nightly
battle, and he will get in
bed with me. In the middle
of the night, Iʼll turn to
face him and press myself
against him. Iʼll hold
myself to him like a
climbing, coiling vine until

I have invaded every part
of him and made him
mine.

NICK DUNNE
THIRTY
DAYS
AFTER
THE
RETURN

Amy thinks sheʼs in
control, but sheʼs very

wrong. Or: She will be
very wrong.
Boney and Go and I are
working together. The
cops, the FBI, no one else
is showing much interest
anymore. But yesterday
Boney called out of the
blue. She didnʼt identify
herself when I picked up,
just started in like an old
friend: Take you for a cup
of coffee? I grabbed Go,

and we met Boney back at
the Pancake House. She
was already at the booth
when we arrived, and she
stood
and
smiled
somewhat weakly. Sheʼd
been getting pummeled in
the press. We did an
awkward, group-wide hugor-handshake
shuffle.
Boney settled for a nod.
First thing she said to
me once we got our food:

“I have one daughter.
Thirteen years old. Mia.
For Mia Hamm. She was
born the day we won the
World Cup. So, thatʼs my
daughter.”
I raised my eyebrows:
How interesting. Tell me
more.
“You asked that one
day, and I didnʼt … I was
rude. Iʼd been sure you
were
innocent,
and

then … everything said
you werenʼt, so I was
pissed. That I could be that
fooled. So I didnʼt even
want to say my daughterʼs
name around you.” She
poured us out coffee from
the thermos.
“So, itʼs Mia,” she said.
“Well, thank you,” I
said.
“No, I mean … Crap.”
She exhaled upward, a

hard gust that fluttered her
bangs. “I mean: I know
Amy framed you. I know
she
murdered
Desi
Collings. I know it. I just
canʼt prove it.”
“What is everyone else
doing
while
youʼre
actually
working
the
case?” Go asked.
“There is no case.
Theyʼre moving on. Gilpin
is totally checked out. I

basically got the word
from on high: Shut this
shit down. Shut it down.
We look like giant, rube,
redneck jackasses in the
national media. I canʼt do
anything unless I get
something from you, Nick.
You got anything?”
I shrugged. “I got
everything you got. She
confessed to me, but—”
“She confessed?” she

said. “Well, hell, Nick,
weʼll wire you.”
“It wonʼt work. It wonʼt
work. She thinks of
everything. I mean, she
knows police procedure
cold. She studies, Rhonda.”
She poured electricblue syrup over her
waffles. I stuck the tines of
my fork in my bulbous egg
yolk and swirled it,
smearing the sun.

“It drives me crazy
when
you
call
me
Rhonda.”
“She
studies,
Ms.
Detective Boney.”
She blew her breath
upward,
fluttered
her
bangs again. Took a bite of
pancake. “I couldnʼt get a
wire anyway at this point.”
“Come on, there has to
be something, you guys,”
Go snapped. “Nick, why

the hell are you staying in
that house if you arenʼt
getting something?”
“It takes time, Go. I
have to get her to trust me
again. If she starts telling
me things casually, when
weʼre not both stark naked
—”
Boney rubbed her eyes
and addressed Go: “Do I
even want to ask?”
“They always have

their talks naked in the
shower with the water
running,” Go said. “Canʼt
you bug the shower
somewhere?”
“She whispers in my
ear, on top of the shower
running,” I said.
“She
does
study,”
Boney said. “She really
does. I went over that car
she drove back, Desiʼs Jag.
I had ʼem check the trunk,

where she swore Desi had
stowed her when he
kidnapped her. I figured
thereʼd be nothing there—
weʼd catch her in a lie. She
rolled around in the trunk,
Nick. Her scent was
detected by our dogs. And
we found three long blond
hairs. Long blond hairs.
Hers before she cut it.
How she did that—”
“Foresight. Iʼm sure she

had a bag of them so if she
needed to leave them
somewhere to damn me,
she could.”
“Good God, can you
imagine having her for a
mother? You could never
fib. Sheʼd be three steps
ahead of you, always.”
“Boney,
can
you
imagine having her for a
wife?”
“Sheʼll crack,” she said.

“At some point, sheʼll
crack.”
“She wonʼt,” I said.
“Canʼt I just testify against
her?”
“You
have
no
credibility,” Boney said.
“Your
only
credibility
comes from Amy. Sheʼs
single-handedly
rehabilitated you. And she
can single-handedly undo
it. If she comes out with

the antifreeze story …”
“I need to find the
vomit,” I said. “If I got rid
of the vomit and we
exposed more of her
lies …”
“We should go through
the diary,” Go said. “Seven
years of entries? There
have to be discrepancies.”
“We asked Rand and
Marybeth to go through it,
see if anything seemed off

to them,” Boney said. “You
can guess how that went. I
thought Marybeth was
going to scratch my eyes
out.”
“What about Jacqueline
Collings,
or
Tommy
OʼHara, or Hilary Handy?”
Go said. “They all know
the real Amy. There has to
be something there.”
Boney shook her head.
“Believe me, itʼs not

enough. Theyʼre all less
credible than Amy. Itʼs
pure public opinion, but
right now thatʼs what the
department is looking at:
public opinion.”
She
was
right.
Jacqueline Collings had
popped up on a few cable
shows, insisting on her
sonʼs
innocence.
She
always started off steady,
but her motherʼs love

worked against her: She
soon came across as a
grieving woman desperate
to believe the best of her
son, and the more the
hosts pitied her, the more
she snapped and snarled,
and
the
more
unsympathetic
she
became. She got written
off quickly. Both Tommy
OʼHara and Hilary Handy
called me, furious that

Amy
remained
unpunished, determined to
tell their story, but no one
wanted to hear from two
unhinged
former
anythings. Hold tight, I told
them, weʼre working on it.
Hilary and Tommy and
Jacqueline and Boney and
Go and I, weʼd have our
moment. I told myself I
believed it.
“What if we at least got

Andie?” I asked. “Got her
to testify that everywhere
Amy hid a clue was a place
where weʼd, you know,
had sex? Andieʼs credible;
people love her.”
Andie had reverted to
her old cheery self after
Amy returned. I know that
only from the occasional
tabloid snapshots. From
these, I know she has been
dating a guy her age, a

cute, shaggy kid with earbuds forever dangling from
his neck. They look nice
together,
young
and
healthy. The press adored
them. The best headline:
Love Finds Andie Hardy!, a
1938
Mickey
Rooney
movie pun only about
twenty people would get. I
sent her a text: Iʼm sorry.
For everything. I didnʼt hear
back. Good for her. I mean

that sincerely.
“Coincidence.” Boney
shrugged. “I mean, weird
coincidence, but … itʼs not
impressive
enough
to
move forward. Not in this
climate. You need to get
your wife to tell you
something useful, Nick.
Youʼre our only chance
here.”
Go slammed down her
coffee. “I canʼt believe

weʼre
having
this
conversation,” she said.
“Nick, I donʼt want you in
that
house
anymore.
Youʼre not an undercover
cop, you know. Itʼs not
your job. You are living
with a murderer. Fucking
leave. Iʼm sorry, but who
gives a shit that she killed
Desi? I donʼt want her to
kill you. I mean, someday
you burn her grilled

cheese, and the next thing
you know, my phoneʼs
ringing and youʼve taken
an awful fall from the roof
or some shit. Leave.”
“I canʼt. Not yet. Sheʼll
never really let me go. She
likes the game too much.”
“Then stop playing it.”
I canʼt. Iʼm getting so
much better at it. I will
stay close to her until I can
bring her down. Iʼm the

only one left who can do
it. Someday sheʼll slip and
tell me something I can
use. A week ago I moved
into our bedroom. We
donʼt have sex, we barely
touch, but we are husband
and wife in a marital bed,
which appeases Amy for
now. I stroke her hair. I
take a strand between my
finger and thumb, and I
pull it to the end and tug,

like Iʼm ringing a bell, and
we both like that. Which is
a problem.
We pretend to be in
love, and we do the things
we like to do when weʼre
in love, and it feels almost
like
love
sometimes,
because
we
are
so
perfectly putting ourselves
through
the
paces.
Reviving
the
muscle
memory of early romance.

When I forget—I can
sometimes briefly forget
who my wife is—I actually
like hanging out with her.
Or
the
her
she
is
pretending to be. The fact
is, my wife is a murderess
who is sometimes really
fun. May I give one
example? One night I flew
in lobster like the old days,
and she pretended to chase
me with it, and I

pretended to hide, and
then we both at the same
time made an Annie Hall
joke, and it was so perfect,
so the way it was supposed
to be, that I had to leave
the room for a second. My
heart was beating in my
ears. I had to repeat my
mantra: Amy killed a man,
and she will kill you if you
are not very, very careful.
My wife, the very fun,

beautiful murderess, will
do me harm if I displease
her. I find myself jittery in
my own house: I will be
making
a
sandwich,
standing in the kitchen
midday, licking the peanut
butter off the knife, and I
will turn and find Amy in
the same room with me—
those quiet little cat feet—
and I will quiver. Me, Nick
Dunne, the man who used

to forget so many details,
is now the guy who
replays conversations to
make sure I didnʼt offend,
to make sure I never hurt
her feelings. I write down
everything about her day,
her likes and dislikes, in
case she quizzes me. I am
a great husband because I
am very afraid she may
kill me.
Weʼve never had a

conversation about my
paranoia, because weʼre
pretending to be in love
and Iʼm pretending not to
be frightened of her. But
sheʼs
made
glancing
mentions of it: You know,
Nick, you can sleep in bed
with me, like, actually sleep.
It will be okay. I promise.
What happened with Desi
was an isolated incident.
Close your eyes and sleep.

But I know Iʼll never
sleep again. I canʼt close
my eyes when Iʼm next to
her. Itʼs like sleeping with
a spider.

AMY ELLIOTT
DUNNE
EIGHT WEEKS
AFTER THE
RETURN

No one has arrested
me. The police have
stopped questioning. I feel

safe. I will be even safer
very soon.
This is how good I feel:
Yesterday
I
came
downstairs for breakfast,
and the jar that held my
vomit was sitting on the
kitchen counter, empty.
Nick—the scrounger—had
gotten rid of that little bit
of leverage. I blinked an
eye, and then I tossed out
the jar.

It hardly matters now.
Good
things
are
happening.
I have a book deal: I
am officially in control of
our
story.
It
feels
wonderfully
symbolic.
Isnʼt that what every
marriage is, anyway? Just
a lengthy game of he-said,
she-said? Well, she is
saying, and the world will
listen, and Nick will have

to smile and agree. I will
write him the way I want
him to be: romantic and
thoughtful and very very
repentant—about
the
credit cards and the
purchases
and
the
woodshed. If I canʼt get
him to say it out loud,
heʼll say it in my book.
Then heʼll come on tour
with me and smile and
smile.

Iʼm calling the book
simply: Amazing. Causing
great wonder or surprise;
astounding. That sums up
my story, I think.

NICK DUNNE
NINE
WEEKS
AFTER
THE
RETURN

I found the vomit.
Sheʼd hidden it in the back

of the freezer in a jar,
inside a box of Brussels
sprouts. The box was
covered in icicles; it must
have been sitting there for
months. I know it was her
own joke with herself: Nick
wonʼt eat his vegetables,
Nick never cleans out the
fridge, Nick wonʼt think to
look here.
But Nick did.
Nick knows how to

clean out the refrigerator,
it turns out, and Nick even
knows how to defrost: I
poured all that sick down
the drain, and I left the jar
on the counter so sheʼd
know.
She tossed it in the
garbage. She never said a
word about it.
Somethingʼs wrong. I
donʼt know what it is, but
somethingʼs very wrong.

My life has begun to
feel like an epilogue.
Tanner picked up a new
case: A Nashville singer
discovered his wife was
cheating, and her body
was found the next day in
a Hardeeʼs trash bin near
their house, a hammer
covered
with
his
fingerprints beside her.
Tanner is using me as a
defense. I know it looks

bad, but it also looked bad
for Nick Dunne, and you
know how that turned out. I
could almost feel him
winking at me through the
camera lens. He sent the
occasional text: U OK? Or:
Anything? No, nothing.
Boney and Go and I
hung out in secret at the
Pancake House, where we
sifted the dirty sand of
Amyʼs story, trying to find

something we could use.
We scoured the diary, an
elaborate
anachronism
hunt. It came down to
desperate nitpickings like:
“She makes a comment
here about Darfur, was
that on the radar in
2010?” (Yes, we found a
2006
newsclip
with
George Clooney discussing
it.) Or my own best worst:
“Amy makes a joke in the

July 2008 entry about
killing a hobo, but I feel
like
dead-hobo
jokes
werenʼt big until 2009.” To
which Boney replied: “Pass
the syrup, freakshow.”
People peeled away,
went on with their lives.
Boney stayed. Go stayed.
Then
something
happened.
My
father
finally died. At night, in
his sleep. A woman

spooned his last meal into
his mouth, a woman
settled him into bed for his
last rest, a woman cleaned
him up after he died, and a
woman phoned to give me
the news.
“He was a good man,”
she said, dullness with an
obligatory injection of
empathy.
“No, he wasnʼt,” I said,
and she laughed like she

clearly hadnʼt in a month.
I thought it would
make me feel better to
have the man vanished
from the earth, but I
actually felt a massive,
frightening
hollowness
open up in my chest. I had
spent my life comparing
myself to my father, and
now he was gone, and
there was only Amy left to
bat against. After the

small,
dusty,
lonely
service, I didnʼt leave with
Go, I went home with
Amy, and I clutched her to
me. Thatʼs right, I went
home with my wife.
I have to get out of this
house, I thought. I have to
be done with Amy once and
for all. Burn us down, so I
couldnʼt ever go back.
Who would I be without
you?

I had to find out. I had
to tell my own story. It
was all so clear.
The next morning, as
Amy was in her study
clicking away at the keys,
telling the world her
Amazing story, I took my
laptop downstairs and
stared at the glowing
white screen.
I started on the opening
page of my own book.

I am a cheating, weakspined,
woman-fearing
coward, and I am the hero
of your story. Because the
woman I cheated on—my
wife, Amy Elliott Dunne—is
a sociopath and a murderer.
Yes. Iʼd read that.

AMY
ELLIOTT
DUNNE
TEN
WEEKS

THE
RETURN

Nick still pretends with

me. We pretend together
that we are happy and
carefree and in love. But I
hear him clicking away
late at night on the
computer. Writing. Writing
his side, I know it. I know
it, I can tell by the feverish
outpouring of words, the
keys clicking and clacking
like a million insects. I try
to hack in when heʼs
asleep (although he sleeps

like me now, fussy and
anxious, and I sleep like
him). But heʼs learned his
lesson, that heʼs no longer
beloved Nicky, safe from
wrong—he no longer uses
his birthday or his momʼs
birthday or Bleeckerʼs
birthday as a password. I
canʼt get in.
Still, I hear him typing,
rapidly and without pause,
and I can picture him

hunched
over
the
keyboard, his shoulders
up, his tongue clamped
between his teeth, and I
know that I was right to
protect myself. To take my
precaution.
Because
he
isnʼt
writing a love story.

NICK DUNNE
TWENTY WEEKS
AFTER THE
RETURN

I didnʼt move out. I
wanted this all to be a
surprise to my wife, who is
never surprised. I wanted

to give her the manuscript
as I walked out the door to
land a book deal. Let her
feel that trickling horror of
knowing the world is
about to tilt and dump its
shit all over you, and you
canʼt do anything about it.
No, she may never go to
prison, and it will always
be my word against hers,
but
my
case
was
convincing. It had an

emotional resonance, if not
a legal one.
So let everyone take
sides. Team Nick, Team
Amy. Turn it into even
more of a game: Sell some
fucking T-shirts.
My legs were weak
when I went to tell Amy: I
was no longer part of her
story.
I showed her the
manuscript, displayed the

glaring title: Psycho Bitch.
A little inside joke. We
both like our inside jokes. I
waited for her to scratch
my cheeks, rip my clothes,
bite me.
“Oh!
What
perfect
timing,”
she
said
cheerfully, and gave me a
big grin. “Can I show you
something?”
I made her do it again
in front of me. Piss on the

stick, me squatting next to
her on the bathroom floor,
watching the urine come
out of her and hitting the
stick and turning it
pregnant-blue.
Then I hustled her into
the car and drove to the
doctorʼs office, and I
watched the blood come
out of her—because she
isnʼt really afraid of blood
—and we waited the two

hours for the test to come
back.
Amy was pregnant.
“Itʼs
obviously
not
mine,” I said.
“Oh, it is.” She smiled
back. She tried to snuggle
into
my
arms.
“Congratulations, Dad.”
“Amy—”
I
began,
because of course it wasnʼt
true, I hadnʼt touched my
wife since her return. Then

I saw it: the box of tissues,
the vinyl recliner, the TV
and porn, and my semen
in a hospital freezer
somewhere. Iʼd left that
will-destroy notice on the
table, a limp guilt trip, and
then
the
notice
disappeared, because my
wife had taken action, as
always, and that action
wasnʼt to get rid of the
stuff but to save it. Just in

case.
I felt a giant bubble of
joy—I couldnʼt help it—
and then the joy was
encased in a metallic
terror.
“Iʼll need to do a few
things for my security,
Nick,” she said. “Just
because, I have to say, itʼs
almost impossible to trust
you. To start, youʼll have
to delete your book,

obviously. And just to put
that other matter to rest,
weʼll need an affidavit,
and youʼll need to swear
that it was you who
bought the stuff in the
woodshed and hid the stuff
in the woodshed, and that
you did once think I was
framing you, but now you
love me and I love you and
everything is good.”
“What if I refuse?”

She put her hand on
her small, swollen belly
and frowned. “I think that
would be awful.”
We had spent years
battling for control of our
marriage, of our love
story, our life story. I had
been thoroughly, finally
outplayed. I created a
manuscript,
and
she
created a life.
I could fight for

custody, but I already
knew Iʼd lose. Amy would
relish the battle—God
knew what she already
had lined up. By the time
she was done, I wouldnʼt
even be an every-otherweekend dad; I would
interact with my child in
strange rooms with a
guardian nearby sipping
coffee, watching me. Or
maybe not even that. I

could suddenly see the
accusations—of
molestation or abuse—and
I would never see my
baby, and I would know
that my child was tucked
away far from me, Mother
whispering,
whispering
lies into that tiny pink ear.
“Itʼs a boy, by the
way,” she said.
I was a prisoner after
all. Amy had me forever,

or as long as she wanted,
because I needed to save
my son, to try to unhook,
unlatch, debarb, undo
everything that Amy did. I
would literally lay down
my life for my child, and
do it happily. I would raise
my son to be a good man.
I deleted my story.
Boney picked up on the
first ring.
“Pancake
House?

Twenty minutes?” she said.
“No.”
I informed Rhonda
Boney that I was going to
be a father and so could no
longer assist in any
investigation—that I was,
in fact, planning to retract
any statement Iʼd made
concerning my misplaced
belief that my wife had
framed me, and I was also
ready to admit my role in

the credit cards.
A long pause on the
line. “Hunh,” she said.
“Hunh.”
I could picture Boney
running her hand through
her slack hair, chewing on
the inside of her cheek.
“You take care of
yourself, okay, Nick?” she
said finally. “Take good
care of the little one too.”
Then she laughed. “Amy I

donʼt really give a fuck
about.”
I went to Goʼs house to
tell her in person. I tried to
frame it as happy news. A
baby, you canʼt be that
upset about a baby. You
can hate a situation, but
you canʼt hate a child.
I thought Go was going
to hit me. She stood so
close I could feel her
breath. She jabbed me

with an index finger.
“You just want an
excuse to stay,” she
whispered.
“You
two,
youʼre fucking addicted to
each other. You are
literally going to be a
nuclear family, you do
know that? You will
explode. You will fucking
detonate. You really think
you can possibly do this
for,
what,
the
next

eighteen years? You donʼt
think sheʼll kill you?”
“Not as long as I am the
man she married. I wasnʼt
for a while, but I can be.”
“You donʼt think youʼll
kill her? You want to turn
into Dad?”
“Donʼt you see, Go?
This is my guarantee not to
turn into Dad. Iʼll have to
be the best husband and
father in the world.”

Go burst into tears then
—the first time Iʼd seen
her cry since she was a
child. She sat down on the
floor, straight down, as if
her legs gave out. I sat
down beside her and
leaned my head against
hers. She finally swallowed
her last sob and looked at
me. “Remember when I
said, Nick, I said Iʼd still
love you if? Iʼd love you

no matter what came after
the if?”
“Yes.”
“Well, I still love you.
But this breaks my heart.”
She let out an awful sob, a
childʼs
sob.
“Things
werenʼt supposed to turn
out this way.”
“Itʼs a strange twist,” I
said, trying to turn it light.
“She wonʼt try to keep
us apart, will she?”

“No,”
I
said.
“Remember,
sheʼs
pretending to be someone
better too.”
Yes, I am finally a
match for Amy. The other
morning I woke up next to
her, and I studied the back
of her skull. I tried to read
her thoughts. For once I
didnʼt feel like I was
staring into the sun. Iʼm
rising to my wifeʼs level of

madness. Because I can
feel her changing me
again: I was a callow boy,
and then a man, good and
bad. Now at last Iʼm the
hero. I am the one to root
for in the never-ending
war story of our marriage.
Itʼs a story I can live with.
Hell, at this point, I canʼt
imagine my story without
Amy. She is my forever
antagonist.

We are one
frightening climax.

AMY ELLIOTT
DUNNE
TEN MONTHS,
TWO WEEKS, SIX
DAYS AFTER
THE RETURN

I was told love should
be unconditional. Thatʼs

the rule, everyone says so.
But if love has no
boundaries, no limits, no
conditions, why should
anyone try to do the right
thing ever? If I know I am
loved no matter what,
where is the challenge? I
am supposed to love Nick
despite
all
his
shortcomings. And Nick is
supposed to love me
despite my quirks. But

clearly, neither of us does.
It makes me think that
everyone is very wrong,
that love should have
many conditions. Love
should
require
both
partners to be their very
best
at
all
times.
Unconditional love is an
undisciplined love, and as
we
all
have
seen,
undisciplined
love
is
disastrous.

in Amazing. Out soon!
But first: motherhood.
The due date is tomorrow.
Tomorrow happens to be
our anniversary. Year six.
Iron. I thought about
giving Nick a nice pair of
handcuffs, but he may not
find that funny yet. Itʼs so
strange to think: A year
ago today, I was undoing

my husband. Now I am
almost done reassembling
him.
Nick has spent all his
free time these past
months slathering my belly
with cocoa butter and
running out for pickles and
rubbing my feet, and all
the things good fathers-tobe are supposed to do.
Doting on me. He is
learning to love me

unconditionally, under all
my conditions. I think we
are finally on our way to
happiness. I have finally
figured it out.
We are on the eve of
becoming the worldʼs best,
brightest nuclear family.
We just need to sustain
it. Nick doesnʼt have it
down
perfect.
This
morning he was stroking
my hair and asking what

else he could do for me,
and I said: “My gosh, Nick,
why are you so wonderful
to me?”
He was supposed to
say: You deserve it. I love
you.
But he said, “Because I
feel sorry for you.”
“Why?”
“Because
every
morning you have to wake
up and be you.”

I really, truly wish he
hadnʼt said that. I keep
thinking about it. I canʼt
stop.
I donʼt have anything
else to add. I just wanted
to make sure I had the last
word. I think Iʼve earned
that.

ACKNOWLEDGME

Iʼve got to start with
Stephanie Kip Rostan,
whose smart advice, sound
opinions, and good humor
have seen me through
three books now. Sheʼs

also just really fun to hang
out with. Thanks for all
the excellent guidance
over the years. Many
thanks also to Jim Levine
and Daniel Greenberg and
everyone
at
Levine
Greenberg
Literary
Agency.
My editor, Lindsay
Sagnette, is a dream:
Thank you for lending me
your expert ear, for letting

me be just the right
amount of stubborn, for
challenging me to do
better, and for cheering me
on during that last stretch
—if it werenʼt for you, Iʼd
have
remained
“82.6
percent done” forever.
Much thanks to Crown
publisher Molly Stern for
the feedback, the support,
the sage comments, and
the endless energy.

Gratitude
also
to
Annsley Rosner, Christine

always to Kirsty Dunseath
and the gang at Orion.
For my many questions
about police and legal
procedures, I turned to
some
very
gracious

experts. Thanks to my
uncle, the Hon. Robert M.
Schieber, and to Lt. Emmet
B. Helrich for always
letting me run ideas by
them. Huge thanks this
round to defense attorney
Molly Hastings in Kansas
City, who explained her
job with great grace and
conviction. And endless
gratitude to Det. Craig
Enloe of the Overland Park

Police Department for
answering my 42,000 emails (a modest estimate)
over the past two years
with
patience,
good
humor, and exactly the
right
amount
of
information. Any mistakes
are mine.

For
my
wonderful
Missouri family—all the
Schiebers, the Welshes, the
Flynns,
and
branches
thereof. Thanks for all the
love,
support,
laughs,
pickle rolls, and bourbon
slush … basically for
making Missouri, as Nick
would say, “a magical
place.”
I
received
some
incredibly helpful feedback

from a few readers who
are also good friends.
Marcus Sakey gave me
sharp advice about Nick
early on over beer and
Thai food. David MacLean
and Emily Stone (deareth!)
were kind enough to read
Gone Girl in the months
leading
up
to
their
wedding. It doesnʼt seem
to have harmed you guys
in the least, and it made

the book a lot better, so
thanks. Nothing will stop
you from getting to the
Caymans!
Scott Brown: Thanks
for all the writing retreats
during the Gone Girl
Years,
especially
the
Ozarks. Iʼm glad we didnʼt
sink the paddleboat after
all. Thanks for your
incredibly insightful reads,
and for always swooping

in
and
helping
me
articulate what the hell it
is Iʼm trying to say. You
are a good Monster and a
wonderful friend.
Thanks to my brother,
Travis Flynn, for always
being around to answer
questions
about
how
things
actually
work.
Much love to Ruth Flynn,
Brandon Flynn, and Holly
Bailey.

To my in-laws, Cathy
and Jim Nolan, Jennifer
Nolan, Megan, Pablo, and
Xavy Marroquin—and all
the Nolans and Samsons: I
am very aware of how
lucky I am to have married
into your family. Thanks
for everything. Cathy, we
always knew you had one
hell of a heart, but this
past year proved it in so
many ways.

To my parents, Matt
and
Judith
Flynn.
Encouraging, thoughtful,
funny,
kind,
creative,
supportive, and still madly
in love after more than
forty years. I am, as
always, in awe of you
both. Thanks for being so
good to me and for always
taking the time to harass
strangers into buying my
books. And thank you for

being so lovely with Flynn
—I become a better parent
just watching you.
Finally, my guys.
Roy: Good kitty.
Flynn: Beloved boy, I
adore you! Also, if you are
reading this before the
year 2024, you are too
little. Put it down and pick
up Frumble!
Brett: Husband! Father
of
my
child!
Dance

partner, emergency grilledcheese maker. The kind of
fellow who knows how to
pick the wine. The kind of
fellow who looks great in a
tux. Also a zombie-tux.
The guy with the generous
laugh and the glorious
whistle. The guy who has
the answer. The man who
makes my child laugh till
he falls down. The man
who makes me laugh till I

lets me ask all sorts of
invasive,
inappropriate,
and intrusive questions
about being a guy. The
man who read and reread
and reread and then
reread, and not only gave
advice, but gave me a
bourbon app. Youʼre it,
baby. Thanks for marrying
me.
Two words, always.

was new, stinging red and
ugly. It was May 12 but
the
temperature
had
dipped to the forties, and
after four days shivering in

my shirtsleeves, I grabbed
cover at a tag sale rather
than dig through my
boxed-up winter clothes.
Spring in Chicago.
In my gunny-covered
cubicle I sat staring at the
computer screen. My story
for the day was a limp sort
of evil. Four kids, ages two
through six, were found
locked in a room on the
South Side with a couple

of tuna sandwiches and a
quart of milk. Theyʼd been
left three days, flurrying
like chickens over the food
and feces on the carpet.
Their
mother
had
wandered off for a suck on
the pipe and just forgotten.
Sometimes thatʼs what
happens.
No
cigarette
burns, no bone snaps. Just
an irretrievable slipping.
Iʼd seen the mother after

the arrest: twenty-twoyear-old Tammy Davis,
blonde and fat, with pink
rouge on her cheeks in two
perfect circles the size of
shot glasses. I could
imagine her sitting on a
shambled-down sofa, her
lips on that metal, a sharp
burst of smoke. Then all
was fast floating, her kids
way behind, as she shot
back to junior high, when

the boys still cared and she
was the prettiest, a glossylipped
thirteen-year-old
who mouthed cinnamon
sticks before she kissed.
A belly. A smell.
Cigarettes and old coffee.
My
editor,
esteemed,
weary
Frank
Curry,
rocking
back
in
his
cracked Hush Puppies. His
teeth soaked in brown
tobacco saliva.

“Where are you on the
story, kiddo?” There was a
silver tack on my desk,
point up. He pushed it
lightly under a yellow
thumbnail.
“Near done.” I had
three inches of copy. I
needed ten.
“Good. Fuck her, file it,
and come to my office.”
“I can come now.”
“Fuck her, file it, then

come to my office.”
“Fine. Ten minutes.” I
wanted my thumbtack
back.
He started out of my
cubicle. His tie swayed
down near his crotch.
“Preaker?”
“Yes, Curry?”
“Fuck her.”
Frank Curry thinks Iʼm
a soft touch. Might be
because Iʼm a woman.

soft touch.
urryʼs office is
on the third floor. Iʼm sure
he gets panicky-pissed
every time he looks out
the window and sees the
trunk of a tree. Good
editors donʼt see bark;
they see leaves—if they
can even make out trees
from up on the twentieth,
thirtieth floor. But for the

C

Daily Post, fourth-largest
paper
in
Chicago,
relegated to the suburbs,
thereʼs room to sprawl.
Three floors will do,
spreading
relentlessly
outward, like a spill,
unnoticed
among
the
carpet retailers and lamp
shops.
A
corporate
developer produced our
township over three wellorganized years—1961–64

—then named it after his
daughter, whoʼd suffered a
serious equestrian accident
a month before the job
was
finished.
Aurora
Springs,
he
ordered,
pausing for a photo by a
brand-new city sign. Then
he took his family and left.
The daughter, now in her
fifties and fine except for
an occasional tingling in
her arms, lives in Florida

and returns every few
years to take a photo by
her namesake sign, just
like Pop.
I wrote the story on her
last visit. Curry hated it,
hates most slice-of-life
pieces. He got smashed off
old Chambord while he
read it, left his office
smelling like raspberries.
Curry gets drunk fairly
quietly, but often. Itʼs not

the reason, though, that he
has such a cozy view of
the ground. Thatʼs just
yawing bad luck.
I walked in and shut
the door to his office,
which isnʼt how Iʼd ever
imagined
my
editorʼs
office would look. I craved
big oak panels, a window
pane in the door—marked
Chief—so
the
cub
reporters could watch us

rage
over
First
Amendment rights. Curryʼs
office
is
bland
and
institutional, like the rest
of the building. You could
debate journalism or get a
Pap smear. No one cared.
“Tell me about Wind
Gap.” Curry held the tip of
a ballpoint pen at his
grizzled chin. I could
picture the tiny prick of
blue it would leave among

the stubble.
“Itʼs at the very bottom
of Missouri, in the boot
heel. Spitting distance
from
Tennessee
and
Arkansas,” I said, hustling
for my facts. Curry loved
to drill reporters on any
topics he deemed pertinent
—the number of murders
in Chicago last year, the
demographics for Cook
County, or, for some

reason, the story of my
hometown, a topic I
preferred to avoid. “Itʼs
been around since before
the
Civil
War,”
I
continued. “Itʼs near the
Mississippi, so it was a
port city at one point. Now
its biggest business is hog
butchering. About two
thousand people live there.
Old money and trash.”
“Which are you?”

“Iʼm trash. From old
money.” I smiled. He
frowned.
“And what the hell is
going on?”
I sat silent, cataloguing
various
disasters
that
might have befallen Wind
Gap. Itʼs one of those
crummy towns prone to
misery: A bus collision or a
twister. An explosion at
the silo or a toddler down

a well. I was also sulking a
bit. Iʼd hoped—as I always
do when Curry calls me
into his office—that he
was going to compliment
me on a recent piece,
promote me to a better
beat, hell, slide over a slip
of paper with a 1 percent
raise scrawled on it—but I
was unprepared to chat
about current events in
Wind Gap.

“Your momʼs still there,
right, Preaker?”
“Mom. Stepdad.” A half
sister born when I was in
college, her existence so
unreal to me I often forgot
her name. Amma. And
then Marian, always longgone Marian.
“Well dammit, you ever
talk to them?” Not since
Christmas: a chilly, polite
call after administering

three
bourbons.
Iʼd
worried my mother could
smell it through the phone
lines.
“Not lately.”
“Jesus Christ, Preaker,
read the wires sometime. I
guess there was a murder
last August? Little girl
strangled?”
I nodded like I knew. I
was lying. My mother was
the only person in Wind

Gap with whom I had even
a limited connection, and
sheʼd
said
nothing.
Curious.
“Now another oneʼs
missing. Sounds like it
might be a serial to me.
Drive down there and get
me the story. Go quick. Be
there tomorrow morning.”
No way. “We got horror
stories here, Curry.”
“Yeah, and we also got

three competing papers
with twice the staff and
cash.” He ran a hand
through his hair, which
fell into frazzled spikes.
“Iʼm
sick
of
getting
slammed out of news. This
is our chance to break
something. Big.”
Curry believes with just
the right story, weʼd
become
the
overnight
paper of choice in Chicago,

gain national credibility.
Last year another paper,
not us, sent a writer to his
hometown somewhere in
Texas after a group of
teens drowned in the
spring floods. He wrote an
elegiac but well-reported
piece on the nature of
water and regret, covered
everything from the boysʼ
basketball team, which
lost its three best players,

to the local funeral home,
which was desperately
unskilled in cleaning up
drowned corpses. The
story won a Pulitzer.
I still didnʼt want to go.
So much so, apparently,
that Iʼd wrapped my hands
around the arms of my
chair, as if Curry might try
to pry me out. He sat and
stared at me a few beats
with his watery hazel eyes.

He cleared his throat,
looked at his photo of his
wife, and smiled like he
was a doctor about to
break bad news. Curry
loved to bark—it fit his
old-school image of an
editor—but he was also
one of the most decent
people I knew.
“Look, kiddo, if you
canʼt do this, you canʼt do
it. But I think it might be

good for you. Flush some
stuff out. Get you back on
your feet. Itʼs a damn good
story—we need it. You
need it.”
Curry
had
always
backed me. He thought Iʼd
be his best reporter, said I
had a surprising mind. In
my two years on the job
Iʼd consistently fallen short
of expectations. Sometimes
strikingly. Now I could feel

him across the desk,
urging me to give him a
little faith. I nodded in
what I hoped was a
confident fashion.
“Iʼll go pack.” My
hands left sweatprints on
the chair.
had no pets to
worry about, no plants to
leave with a neighbor. Into
a duffel bag, I tucked away
enough clothes to last me

I

five
days,
my
own
reassurance Iʼd be out of
Wind Gap before weekʼs
end. As I took a final
glance around my place, it
revealed itself to me in a
rush.
The
apartment
looked like a college kidʼs:
cheap, transitory, and
mostly
uninspired.
I
promised myself Iʼd invest
in a decent sofa when I
returned as a reward for

the stunning story I was
sure to dig up.
On the table by the
door sat a photo of a
preteen me holding Marian
at about age seven. Weʼre
both laughing. She has her
eyes wide open in surprise,
I have mine scrunched
shut. Iʼm squeezing her
into me, her short skinny
legs dangling over my
knees. I canʼt remember

the occasion or what we
were laughing about. Over
the years itʼs become a
pleasant mystery. I think I
like not knowing.
take baths. Not
showers. I canʼt handle the
spray, it gets my skin
buzzing, like someoneʼs
turned on a switch. So I
wadded a flimsy motel
towel over the grate in the
shower floor, aimed the

I

nozzle at the wall, and sat
in the three inches of
water that pooled in the
stall. Someone elseʼs pubic
hair floated by.
I got out. No second
towel, so I ran to my bed
and blotted myself with
the cheap spongy blanket.
Then I drank warm
bourbon and cursed the ice
machine.
Wind Gap is about

eleven hours south of
Chicago.
Curry
had
graciously allowed me a
budget for one nightʼs
motel stay and breakfast in
the morning, if I ate at a
gas station. But once I got
in town, I was staying at
my motherʼs. That he
decided for me. I already
knew the reaction Iʼd get
when I showed up at her
door. A quick, shocked

flustering, her hand to her
hair, a mismatched hug
that would leave me aimed
slightly to one side. Talk of
the messy house, which
wouldnʼt be. A query
about length of stay
packaged in niceties.
“How long do we get to
have you for, sweetness?”
sheʼd say. Which meant:
“When do you leave?”
Itʼs the politeness that I

find most upsetting.
I knew I should prepare
my notes, jot down
questions. Instead I drank
more
bourbon,
then
popped
some
aspirin,
turned off the light. Lulled
by the wet purr of the air
conditioner
and
the
electric plinking of some
video game next door, I
fell asleep. I was only
thirty miles outside my

hometown, but I needed
one last night away.

Dark Places

Libby Day
NOW

I

have a meanness
inside me, real as an
organ. Slit me at my belly
and it might slide out,
meaty and dark, drop on
the floor so you could
stomp on it. Itʼs the Day

blood. Somethingʼs wrong
with it. I was never a good
little girl, and I got worse
after the murders. Little
Orphan Libby grew up
sullen
and
boneless,
shuffled around a group of
lesser
relatives—second
cousins and great-aunts
and friends of friends—
stuck in a series of mobile
homes or rotting ranch
houses all across Kansas.

Me going to school in my
dead sistersʼ hand-medowns:
Shirts
with
mustardy armpits. Pants
with
baggy
bottoms,
comically loose, held on
with a raggedy belt
cinched to the farthest
hole. In class photos my
hair was always crooked—
barrettes hanging loosely
from strands, as if they
were
airborne
objects

caught in the tangles—and
I always had bulging
pockets under my eyes,
drunk-landlady
eyes.
Maybe a grudging curve of
the lips where a smile
should be. Maybe.
I was not a lovable
child, and Iʼd grown into a
deeply unlovable adult.
Draw a picture of my soul,
and itʼd be a scribble with
fangs.

IT WAS MISERABLE,
wet-bone March and I was
lying in bed thinking about
killing myself, a hobby of
mine. Indulgent afternoon
daydreaming: A shotgun,
my mouth, a bang and my
head jerking once, twice,
blood on the wall. Spatter,
splatter. “Did she want to
be buried or cremated?”
people would ask. “Who
should come to the

funeral?” And no one
would know. The people,
whoever they were, would
just look at each otherʼs
shoes or shoulders until
the silence settled in and
then someone would put
on a pot of coffee, briskly
and with a fair amount of
clatter. Coffee goes great
with sudden death.
I pushed a foot out
from under my sheets, but

couldnʼt bring myself to
connect it to the floor. I
am, I guess, depressed. I
guess Iʼve been depressed
for
about
twenty-four
years. I can feel a better
version of me somewhere
in there—hidden behind a
liver or attached to a bit of
spleen within my stunted,
childish body—a Libby
thatʼs telling me to get up,
do something, grow up,

move
on.
But
the
meanness usually wins out.
My brother slaughtered my
family when I was seven.
My mom, two sisters,
gone: bang bang, chop
chop, choke choke. I didnʼt
really have to do anything
after that, nothing was
expected.
I inherited $321,374
when I turned eighteen,
the result of all those well-

wishers whoʼd read about
my sad story, do-gooders
whose hearts had gone out
to me. Whenever I hear
that phrase, and I hear it a
lot, I picture juicy doodlehearts, complete with birdwings, flapping toward
one of my many crap-ass
childhood
homes,
my
little-girl self at the
window,
waving
and
grabbing
each
bright

heart,
green
cash
sprinkling down on me,
thanks, thanks a ton! When
I was still a kid, the
donations were placed in a
conservatively
managed
bank account, which, back
in the day, saw a jump
about every three–four
years,
when
some
magazine or news station
ran an update on me. Little
Libbyʼs Brand New Day:

The Lone Survivor of the
Prairie Massacre Turns a
Bittersweet 10. (Me in
scruffy pigtails on the
possum-pissed
lawn
outside my Aunt Dianeʼs
trailer. Dianeʼs thick treecalves, exposed by a rare
skirt, planted in the yellow
grass behind me.) Brave
Baby Dayʼs Sweet 16! (Me,
still miniature, my face
aglow
with
birthday

candles, my shirt too tight
over breasts that had gone
D-cup that year, comicbook sized on my tiny
frame, ridiculous, porny.)
Iʼd lived off that cash
for more than thirteen
years, but it was almost
gone. I had a meeting that
afternoon to determine
exactly how gone. Once a
year
the
man
who
managed the money, an

unblinking, pink-cheeked
banker
named
Jim
Jeffreys, insisted on taking
me to lunch, a “checkup,”
he called it. Weʼd eat
something in the twentydollar range and talk about
my life—heʼd known me
since I was this-high, after
all, heheh. As for me, I
knew
almost
nothing
about Jim Jeffreys, and
never asked, viewing the

appointments always from
the same kidʼs-eye view:
Be polite, but barely, and
get it over with. Singleword answers, tired sighs.
(The one thing I suspected
about Jim Jeffreys was
that he must be Christian,
churchy—he
had
the
patience and optimism of
someone who thought
Jesus was watching.) I
wasnʼt due for a “checkup”

for another eight or nine
months, but Jim Jeffreys
had nagged, leaving phone
messages in a serious,
hushed voice, saying heʼd
done all he could to extend
the “life of the fund,” but it
was time to think about
“next steps.”
And here again came
the
meanness:
I
immediately thought about
that other little tabloid

girl, Jamie Something,
whoʼd lost her family the
same year—1985. Sheʼd
had part of her face
burned off in a fire her dad
set that killed everyone
else in her family. Any
time I hit the ATM, I think
of that Jamie girl, and how
if she hadnʼt stolen my
thunder, Iʼd have twice as
much money. That Jamie
Whatever was out at some

mall with my cash, buying
fancy
handbags
and
jewelry
and
buttery
department-store makeup
to smooth onto her shiny,
scarred face. Which was a
horrible thing to think, of
course. I at least knew
that.
Finally, finally, finally I
pulled myself out of bed
with a stage-effect groan
and wandered to the front

of my house. I rent a small
brick bungalow within a
loop of other small brick
bungalows, all of which
squat on a massive bluff
overlooking the former
stockyards of Kansas City.
Kansas City, Missouri, not
Kansas
City,
Kansas.
Thereʼs a difference.
My
neighborhood
doesnʼt even have a name,
itʼs so forgotten. Itʼs called

Over There That Way. A
weird, subprime area, full
of dead ends and dog crap.
The other bungalows are
packed with old people
whoʼve lived in them since
they were built. The old
people sit, gray and
pudding-like,
behind
screen windows, peering
out
at
all
hours.
Sometimes they walk to
their cars on careful

elderly tiptoes that make
me feel guilty, like I
should go help. But they
wouldnʼt like that. They
are not friendly old people
—they are tight-lipped,
pissed-off old people who
do not appreciate me
being their neighbor, this
new person. The whole
area hums with their
disapproval. So thereʼs the
noise of their disdain and

thereʼs the skinny red dog
two doors down who barks
all day and howls all night,
the constant background
noise you donʼt realize is
driving you crazy until it
stops, just a few blessed
moments, and then starts
up
again.
The
neighborhoodʼs
only
cheerful sound I usually
sleep through: the morning
coos of toddlers. A troop of

them, round-faced and
multilayered, walk to some
daycare
hidden
even
farther in the ratʼs nest of
streets behind me, each
clutching a section of a
long piece of rope trailed
by a grown-up. They
march, penguin-style, past
my house every morning,
but I have not once seen
them return. For all I
know, they troddle around

the entire world and
return in time to pass my
window again in the
morning. Whatever the
story, I am attached to
them. There are three girls
and a boy, all with a
fondness for bright red
jackets—and when I donʼt
see
them,
when
I
oversleep, I actually feel
blue. Bluer. Thatʼd be the
word my mom would use,

not something as dramatic
as depressed. Iʼve had the
blues
for
twenty-four
years.
I PUT ON a skirt and
blouse for the meeting,
feeling dwarfy, my grownup, big-girl clothes never
quite fitting. Iʼm barely
five foot—four foot, ten
inches in truth, but I round
up. Sue me. Iʼm thirty-one,
but people tend to talk to

me in singsong, like they
want
to
give
me
fingerpaints.
I headed down my
weedy front slope, the
neighborʼs
red
dog
launching
into
its
busybody barking. On the
pavement near my car are
the smashed skeletons of
two baby birds, their
flattened beaks and wings
making
them
look

reptilian. Theyʼve been
there for a year. I canʼt
resist looking at them each
time I get in my car. We
need a good flood, wash
them away.
Two elderly women
were talking on the front
steps of a house across the
street, and I could feel
them refusing to see me. I
donʼt
know
anyoneʼs
name. If one of those

women died, I couldnʼt
even say, “Poor old Mrs.
Zalinsky died.” Iʼd have to
say, “That mean old bitch
across the street bit it.”
Feeling like a child
ghost, I climbed into my
anonymous midsized car,
which seems to be made
mostly of plastic. I keep
waiting for someone from
the dealership to show up
and tell me the obvious:

“Itʼs a joke. You canʼt
actually drive this. We
were kidding.” I trancedrove my toy car ten
minutes downtown to
meet Jim Jeffreys, rolling
into
the
steakhouse
parking lot twenty minutes
late, knowing heʼd smile
all kindly and say nothing
about my tardiness.
I was supposed to call
him from my cell phone

when I arrived so he could
trot out and escort me in.
The restaurant—a great,
old-school KC steakhouse
—is
surrounded
by
hollowed-out
buildings
that concern him, as if a
troop of rapists was
permanently crouched in
their empty husks awaiting
my arrival. Jim Jeffreys is
not going to be The Guy
Who Let Something Bad

Happen to Libby Day.
Nothing bad can happen to
BRAVE BABY DAY, LITTLE
GIRL LOST, the pathetic,
red-headed seven-year-old
with big blue eyes, the
only one who survived the
PRAIRIE MASSACRE, the
KANSAS CRAZE-KILLINGS,
the FARMHOUSE SATAN
SACRIFICE. My mom, two
older sisters, all butchered
by Ben. The only one left,

Iʼd fingered him as the
murderer. I was the cutiepie who brought my Devilworshiping brother to
justice. I was big news.
The Enquirer put my
tearful photo on the front
page with the headline
ANGEL FACE.
I peered into the
rearview mirror and could
see my baby face even
now. My freckles were

faded, and my teeth
straightened, but my nose
was still pug and my eyes
kitten-round. I dyed my
hair now, a white-blonde,
but the red roots had
grown in. It looked like my
scalp
was
bleeding,
especially in the late-day
sunlight. It looked gory. I
lit a cigarette. Iʼd go for
months without smoking,
and then remember: I need

a cigarette. Iʼm like that,
nothing sticks.
“Letʼs go, Baby Day,” I
said aloud. Itʼs what I call
myself when Iʼm feeling
hateful.
I got out of the car and
smoked my way toward
the restaurant, holding the
cigarette in my right hand
so I didnʼt have to look at
the left hand, the mangled
one. It was almost evening:

Migrant clouds floated in
packs across the sky like
buffalo, and the sun was
just low enough to spray
everything pink. Toward
the river, between the
looping highway ramps,
obsolete grain elevators sat
vacant, dusk-black and
pointless.
I walked across the
parking lot all by myself,
atop a constellation of

crushed glass. I was not
attacked. It was, after all,
just past 5 p.m. Jim
Jeffreys was an early-bird
eater, proud of it.
He was sitting at the
bar when I walked in,
sipping a pop, and the first
thing he did, as I knew he
would, was grab his cell
phone from his jacket
pocket and stare at it as if
it had betrayed him.

“Did you call?” he
frowned.
“No, I forgot,” I lied.
He smiled then. “Well,
anyway. Anyway, Iʼm glad
youʼre here, sweetheart.
Ready to talk turkey?”
He slapped two bucks
on
the
bartop,
and
maneuvered us over to a
red
leather
booth
sprouting yellow stuffing
from its cracks. The

broken slits scraped the
backs of my legs as I slid
in. A whoof of cigarette
stink burped out of the
cushions.
Jim
Jeffreys
never
drank liquor in front of
me, and never asked me if
I wanted a drink, but when
the waiter came I ordered
a glass of red wine and
watched him try not to
look
surprised,
or

disappointed, or anything
but Jim Jeffreys–like. What
kind of red? the waiter
asked, and I had no idea,
really—I
never
could
remember the names of
reds or whites, or which
part of the name you were
supposed to say out loud,
so I just said, House. He
ordered a steak, I ordered
a double-stuffed baked
potato, and then the

waiter
left
and
Jim
Jeffreys let out a long
dentist-y sigh and said,
“Well, Libby, we are
entering a very new and
different
stage
here
together.”
“So how much is left?”
I
asked,
thinking
saytenthousandsayten
thousand.
“Do you read those
reports I send you?”

“I sometimes do,” I lied
again. I liked getting mail
but not reading it; the
reports were probably in a
pile somewhere in my
house.
“Have you listened to
my messages?”
“I think your cell phone
is messed up. It cuts out a
lot.” Iʼd listened just long
enough to know I was in
trouble. I usually tuned

out after Jim Jeffreysʼ first
sentence, which always
began: Your friend Jim
Jeffreys here, Libby …
Jim Jeffreys steepled
his fingers and stuck his
bottom lip out. “There is
982 dollars and 12 cents
left in the fund. As Iʼve
mentioned before, had you
been able to replenish it
with any kind of regular
work, weʼd have been able

to keep it afloat, but …” he
tossed out his hands and
grimaced, “things didnʼt
work out that way.”
“What about the book,
didnʼt the book …?”
“Iʼm sorry, Libby, the
book did not. I tell you
this every year. Itʼs not
your
fault,
but
the
book … no. Nothing.”
Years ago, to exploit
my twenty-fifth birthday, a

publisher
of
self-help
books asked me to write
about how Iʼd conquered
the “ghosts of my past.” I
had in no way conquered
much of anything, but I
agreed
to
the
book
anyway, talking over the
phone with a woman in
New Jersey who did the
actual writing. The book
came out at Christmas
time, 2002, with a cover

photo of me sporting an
unfortunate shag haircut.
It was called, Brand New
Day! Donʼt Just Survive
Childhood Trauma—Surpass
It! and it included a few
childhood snapshots of me
and my dead family,
packed
between
two
hundred pages of gloppy,
positive-thinking porridge.
I was paid $8,000, and a
smattering of survivorsʼ

groups invited me to
speak. I flew to Toledo for
a meeting of men whoʼd
been orphaned young; to
Tulsa
for
a
special
gathering of teenagers
whose moms had been
killed by their dads. I
signed my book for mouthbreathing kids who asked
me jarring questions, like
did my mom cook pies. I
signed the book for gray,

needful old men peering at
me from behind bifocals,
their breath blasting burnt
coffee and stomach acid.
“Start a New Day!” Iʼd
write or “A New Day
Awaits!” How lucky to
have a pun for a last name.
The people who came to
meet me always looked
exhausted and desperate,
standing uncertainly near
me in loose packs. The

groups were always small.
Once I realized I wasnʼt
getting paid for any of
this, I refused to go
anywhere. The book had
already bombed anyway.
“It seems like it should
have made more money,” I
mumbled. I really wanted
the book to make money,
in an obsessive childish
way—that feeling that if I
wanted it enough, it

should happen. It should
happen.
“I know,” Jim Jeffreys
said, having nothing more
to say on the subject after
six years. He watched me
drink my wine in silence.
“But in a way, Libby, this
presents you with a really
interesting new phase of
your life. I mean, what do
you want to be when you
grow up?”

I could tell this was
supposed to be charming,
but it brought a burst of
rage up in me. I didnʼt
want to be anything, that
was the fucking point.
“Thereʼs no money
left?”
Jim Jeffreys shook his
head sadly, and started
salting his newly arrived
steak, the blood pooling
around it like bright Kool-

Aid.
“What
about
new
donations—the
twentyfifth anniversary is coming
up.” I felt another splash of
anger, for him making me
say this aloud. Ben started
his killing spree around 2
a.m. on January 3, 1985.
The time stamp on my
familyʼs massacre, and
here I was looking forward
to it. Who said things like

that? Why couldnʼt there
have been even $5,000
left?
He shook his head
again. “Thereʼs no more,
Libby. Youʼre what, thirty?
A woman. People have
moved on. They want to
help other little girls,
not …”
“Not me.”
“Iʼm afraid not.”
“People have moved

on? Really?” I felt a lurch
of abandonment, the way I
always felt as a kid, when
some aunt or cousin was
dropping me off at some
other aunt or cousinʼs
house: Iʼm done, you take
her for a while. And the
new aunt or cousin would
be real nice for about a
week, try real hard with
bitter little me, and
then … in truth it was

usually my fault. It really
was, thatʼs not victim-talk.
I doused one cousinʼs
living room with Aqua Net
and set fire to it. My aunt
Diane, my guardian, my
momʼs sister, my beloved,
took me in—and sent me
away—half a dozen times
before she finally closed
the door for good. I did
very bad things to that
woman.

“There is always a new
murder, Iʼm afraid, Libby,”
Jim Jeffreys was droning.
“People
have
short
attention spans. I mean,
think how crazy peopleʼre
going
about
Lisette
Stephens.”
Lisette Stephens was a
pretty twenty-five-year-old
brunette
whoʼd
disappeared on the way
home from her familyʼs

Thanksgiving dinner. All
of
Kansas
City
was
invested in finding her—
you couldnʼt turn on the
news without seeing her
photo smiling at you. The
story had gone national in
early February. Nothing at
all had happened in the
case for a month. Lisette
Stephens was dead, and
everyone knew that by
now, but no one wanted to

be the first to leave the
party.
“But,” continued Jim
Jeffreys, “I think everyone
would like to hear youʼre
doing well.”
“Awesome.”
“What about college?”
he chewed off a hunk of
meat.
“No.”
“What about we try to
set you up in some sort of

office job, filing and
whatnot?”
“No.” I folded in on
myself, ignoring my meal,
projecting glumness. That
was another of my momʼs
words: glum. It meant
having the blues in a way
that annoyed other people.
Having
the
blues
aggressively.
“Well, why donʼt you
take a week and do some

thinking on it?” He was
devouring his steak, his
fork moving up and down
briskly.
Jim
Jeffreys
wanted to leave. Jim
Jeffreys was done here.
